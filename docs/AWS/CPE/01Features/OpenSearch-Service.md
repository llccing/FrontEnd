## Amazon OpenSearch Service - open source search engine

Simplify AI-powered search, observability, and vector database operations with a secure, cost-effective managed service.

### Introduction

Amazon OpenSearch Service is an AWS-managed service that lets you run and scale OpenSearch clusters without having to worry about managing, monitoring, and maintaining your infrastructure, or having OpenSearch clusters operation expertise. OpenSearch is a distributed, community-driven, Apache 2.0-licensed, open-source search and analytics suite. OpenSearch Service reduces operational overhead, provides enterprise-grade security, high availability, and scalability, and enables you to quickly deploy real-time search, analytics, and generative AI applications. This helps organizations accelerate innovation and improve operational efficiency rather than managing infrastructure. You can choose between precise control with fully managed OpenSearch Service clusters or automatic resource optimization with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless to efficiently scale your vector workloads without incurring unnecessary costs.
