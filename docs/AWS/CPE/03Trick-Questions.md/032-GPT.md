35.A company has terabytes of data in a database that the company can use for  business analysis. The company wants to build an Al-based application that can  build a SQL query from input text that employees provide. The employees have  minimal experience with technology.Which solution meets these requirements? 
A.Generative pre-trained transformers （GPT） 
B.Residual neural network 
C.Support vector machine 
D.WaveNet 

Correct answer: A. Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT)

Why A is correct
The company wants an AI application that takes natural language text from employees (who have minimal tech experience) and turns it into a SQL query. That is a natural language → code generation task, specifically text-to-SQL.  

GPT-style models are designed for:
Understanding natural language prompts
Generating structured text output (like SQL, Python, etc.)
Handling varied phrasing from non-technical users

So GPT (or similar large language models) fits the requirement best.

Why the other options are not suitable
B. Residual neural network (ResNet)  
  Mainly used for image recognition (computer vision), not generating SQL from text.

C. Support vector machine (SVM)  
  A traditional ML classifier/regressor. Good for classification tasks (spam vs not spam), but not for generating SQL queries from free-form text.

D. WaveNet  
  Designed for audio generation (speech/waveform modeling), not text-to-SQL.

Summary
Building SQL queries from user text is a generative NLP/code generation problem → GPT is the right tool.

## explain more 

A. Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) — Best match
What it is:  
A large language model (LLM) based on the Transformer architecture. It is pre-trained on massive text datasets and then can be fine-tuned or prompted to do specific tasks.

What it’s good at:
Understanding natural language questions/requests
Generating text responses
Generating code, including SQL
Converting “plain English” into structured outputs (tables, JSON, queries)

Why it fits this question:  
Employees can type something like:  
“Show total sales by region for the last 3 months”  
and the model can generate a SQL query such as:
SELECT region, SUM(sales) 
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 months'
GROUP BY region;
This is exactly a text-to-SQL use case.

B. Residual neural network (ResNet) — Not suitable
What it is:  
A deep neural network architecture that uses skip connections (“residual connections”) to make it easier to train very deep networks.

What it’s good at:
Computer vision tasks like:
  Image classification (cat vs dog)
  Object detection support
  Image feature extraction

Why it does NOT fit:  
ResNet processes images (pixel arrays), not natural language prompts, and it’s not built for generating SQL or text.

C. Support Vector Machine (SVM) — Not suitable
What it is:  
A classical machine learning algorithm that finds a decision boundary (a “hyperplane”) to separate classes or predict values.

What it’s good at:
Classification (e.g., fraud vs non-fraud, positive vs negative sentiment)
Sometimes regression (SVR)
Works well with smaller/medium datasets and well-defined feature sets

Why it does NOT fit:  
SVM is not a generative model. It does not “write” SQL. At best, you could use it to classify a user request into categories (e.g., “sales query” vs “inventory query”), but it won’t generate a full SQL statement.

D. WaveNet — Not suitable
What it is:  
A deep learning model originally developed by DeepMind for generating raw audio waveforms.

What it’s good at:
Text-to-speech systems (generating realistic speech)
Audio synthesis and modeling sound signals

Why it does NOT fit:  
WaveNet is for audio, not for understanding text and generating SQL queries.

Key idea behind the correct choice
The task is: Natural language input → SQL query output  
That requires an AI model capable of:
Natural language understanding
Structured text/code generation

That’s exactly what GPT/Transformer-based generative models are designed for.
