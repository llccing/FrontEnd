BERTScore uses contextual embeddings (from the BERT model family) to measure the semantic similarity between the model-generated summary and the reference summary.

Synonym Awareness: It can recognize that "The car is fast" and "The vehicle is quick" have the same meaning, even though the words are different.

Contextual Understanding: It evaluates how well the key points and context are captured, which is the primary goal of summarization.
