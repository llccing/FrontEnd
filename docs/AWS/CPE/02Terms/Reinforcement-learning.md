## Reinforcement learning (RL)

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an "agent" learns optimal behavior through interaction with its environment. Rather than relying on explicit programming or labeled datasets, this agent learns by trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties for its actions. This process mirrors how people typically learn naturally, making RL a powerful approach for creating intelligent systems capable of solving complex problems.

### Understanding of reinforcement learning

Reinforcement learning is about learning to make decisions. Imagine an agent, which could be anything from a software program to a robot, navigating an environment. This environment could be a physical space, a virtual game world, or even a market. The agent takes actions within this environment, and those actions can lead to certain outcomes, some more desirable than others.

The goal of the agent is to earn the most rewards possible over time. It does this by learning a policy, which is essentially a strategy that tells it what action to take in any given situation. This policy is refined over many iterations of interacting with the environment.

To illustrate, consider a chess-playing AI. The agent's actions are the moves it makes on the chessboard. The environment is the current state of the game, and the reward is winning the game. Through repeated play and feedback on its moves, the RL agent learns which actions are more likely to lead to victory.
