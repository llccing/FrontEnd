## Generative adversarial network (GAN)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) help machines to create new, realistic data by learning from existing examples. It is introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his team in 2014 and they have transformed how computers generate images, videos, music and more. Unlike traditional models that only recognize or classify data, they take a creative way by generating entirely new content that closely resembles real-world data. This ability helped various fields such as art, gaming, healthcare and data science. In this article, we will see more about GANs and its core concepts.
