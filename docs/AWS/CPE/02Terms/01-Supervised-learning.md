## supervised learning

Supervised learning is a category of machine learning that uses labeled datasets to train algorithms to predict outcomes and recognize patterns. Unlike unsupervised learning, supervised learning algorithms are given labeled training to learn the relationship between the input and the outputs. 

Supervised machine learning algorithms make it easier for organizations to create complex models that can make accurate predictions. As a result, they are widely used across various industries and fields, including healthcare, marketing, financial services, and more.
