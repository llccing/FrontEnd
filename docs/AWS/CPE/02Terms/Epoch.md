## Epoch 

In machine learning, an epoch refers to one complete pass through the entire training dataset where every data sample is passed through the model and its parameters are updated based on the calculated error. The training process requires multiple epochs, allowing the model to improve iteratively by adjusting its parameters based on the calculated error.
