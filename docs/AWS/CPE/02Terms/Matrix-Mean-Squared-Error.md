## Mean Squared Error (MSE)


Mean squared error (MSE) measures the amount of error in statistical models. It assesses the average squared difference between the observed and predicted values. When a model has no error, the MSE equals zero. As model error increases, its value increases. The mean squared error is also known as the mean squared deviation (MSD).

For example, in regression, the mean squared error represents the average squared residual.
