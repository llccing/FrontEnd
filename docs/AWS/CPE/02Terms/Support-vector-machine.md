## Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It tries to find the best boundary known as hyperplane that separates different classes in the data. It is useful when you want to do binary classification like spam vs. not spam or cat vs. dog.
