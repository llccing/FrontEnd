A => C

I would go for C. The tricky phrase is "near-real-time solution", pointing to Firehouse, but it can't send data to DynamoDB, so it leaves us with C as best option.

Kinesis Data Firehose currently supports Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch Service, Splunk, Datadog, NewRelic, Dynatrace, Sumologic, LogicMonitor, MongoDB, and HTTP End Point as destinations.

## 34
B

CloudTrail, to record API calls.

## 35
D

AWS Shield Advanced for EC2.

D => B

## Analysis, the wrong part

- near-real-time solution: Kinesis Data Firehose
