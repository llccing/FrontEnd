You may use presigned URLs to allow someone to upload an object to your Amazon S3 bucket. Using a presigned URL will allow an upload without requiring another party to have AWS security credentials or permissions. A presigned URL is limited by the permissions of the user who creates it. That is, if you receive a presigned URL to upload an object, you can upload an object only if the creator of the URL has the necessary permissions to upload that object.
