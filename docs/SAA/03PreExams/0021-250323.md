snowball cannot be completed within 72 hours.

use vpn, which provide encryption in transit.

## 2/15
AWS Global Accelerator does not support the s3 website and s3 does not provide an IP address but only a DNS name.

## 3/15
use Fargate doesn't need to do the distribution by ourselves.

so, just use Fargate and create a task definition for web application. that's all.


## 4/15
a vpc gateway endpoint for DynamoDB provides private connectivity without any charges.

## 5/15
Amazon Inspector works with both EC2 instances and container images in amazon ECR to identity potential software vulnerabilities and to categorize the severity of the vulnerabilities.

## 6/15
AWS Secrets Manager is enough for setting the password for RDS which used by EC2. and enable automatic rotation on the secret.

## 7/15
AB, both use s3. and EFS, the max time is 90 days. so 2 years is not suitable for this question.

## 8/15
there is no cluster configuration for EC2 instances. and just one EC2 in an AZ. install database. use an AMI to back up the data. 
use EC2 automatic recovery to recover the instance if a disruptive event occurs.

## 9/15
For calclating the third-party times of api call, can use CloudWatch metric to count calls to the service.

## 10/15
RDS multi-AZ would provide an RPO of almost 0 seconds with synchronous data replication.

## 11/15
a game and top 25 players in the world. just use DynamoDB, and set global tables in each required AWS Region for the player data.

## 12/15
consider HA - high availbility, should use two public subnets and two priviate subnets.

## 13/15
Again, the Global Accelerator does not support s3 bucket or CloudFront as endpoints.

So we should consider to use CloudFront, make the thing like this:

client request => Route 53 => CloudFront => s3/ALB.

## 14/15
Alias record and latency policy.

alias <= as Route 53 with ALB requires an A with Alias Record.

latency policy <= the geolocation polify don't improve performance, but helps route traffic based on the location of the users.

### how to differ geolocation and geoproximity policy

Tips to Remember Them
Think in Terms of Focus

Geolocation Policy: Focus on the "WHERE" of the user. Imagine a big global map, and you are dividing it into different areas (countries, regions). Each area has its own rules for where the traffic should go. You can think of it like guiding tourists to different parts of a large building based on which country they come from.
Geoproximity Policy: Focus on the "PROXIMITY" between the user and the resources. Picture yourself as a navigator finding the shortest path between the user and the available resources on the map. The bias is like an adjustment to the magnetic field that slightly shifts how the "closest" is determined.

Associate with Real - World Examples
Geolocation Policy: Link it to things like language preference or local regulations. Just as a restaurant in different countries may serve different cuisines based on local taste, a website can route traffic based on user location for targeted content.
Geoproximity Policy: Connect it with scenarios where speed is of the essence, such as live - streaming events. You'd want viewers to access the stream from the server that can deliver it the fastest, so proximity is key.


## 15/15
AWS Global Accelerator does not work with s3. again and again.

So for s3, just use CloudFront.
