# Knowledge points

## 1/26 EFS

multiple computes can access the same EFS file system at the same time. EC2, ECS, Lambda.

## 2/26 multi-tier application

commonly specifies, API gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB.

## 3/26 DynamoDB Global Table

support sub-second failover to any AWS Region.

## 4/26 AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager

## 5/26 RDS create replica in different region.

## 6/26 VPC endpoints

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-privatelink/what-are-vpc-endpoints.html

### Gateway VPC endpoints

Gateway VPC endpoints provide reliable connectivity to Amazon S3 and DynamoDB without requiring an internet gateway or a NAT device for your VPC. Gateway endpoints do not use AWS PrivateLink, unlike other types of VPC endpoints.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/gateway-endpoints.html

### Interface VPC endpoints

Interface VPC endpoints provide secure and fast network connectivity to AWS services and resources hosted on Amazon EC2 instances without going through the public internet.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/interface-endpoints.html

## 7/26 Lambda@Edge

Lambda@Edge is a feature of Amazon CloudFront that lets you run code closer to users of your application, which improves performance and reduces latency.

## 8/26 Transit Gateway

multiple VPCs and on-premises networks can be connected to a Transit Gateway.

## 9/26 Auto Scaling - Predictive Scaling

Predictive Scaling is a feature of Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling that uses machine learning to predict the future capacity requirements of your application.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-predictive-scaling.html


## 10/26 Database Caching

Remote caches, such as Amazon ElastiCache.


## 11/26 Multi-AZ enabled

notes that Multi-AZ is important for high availability.

## 12/26 S3 Multipart Uploads

Split the Big File into smaller parts. if one part fails, you can retransmit that part without affecting other parts.

## 13/26 Placement Groups

Placement groups are a way to group EC2 instances together in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html

## 14/26 Instance Store

Instance Store is a storage service that provides fast, temporary storage for your Amazon EC2 instances.

## 15/26 NAT Gateway 

configure a NAT gateway in a public subnet. and Define a custom route able witha a route to the NAT gateway for internet traffic and associate it with the private subnets for the application tier.

## 16/26 Amazon FSx for Lustre

Amazon FSx for Lustre is a fully managed, high performance file system that is optimized for compute-intensive workloads.

And S3 and EFS are not ideal for high-performance computing(HPC) workload.

## 17/26 CloudTrail log file validation & SSE-KMS

CloudTrail log file validation is a feature that helps you ensure the integrity of your CloudTrail log files. It uses SHA-256 for hashing and SHA-256 with RSA for digital signing to make it computationally infeasible to modify, delete, or forge CloudTrail log files without detection.

SSE-KMS is a feature that encrypts your CloudTrail log files using a KMS key.

### NAT Instance

to initilize a NAT instance, you need to create a new AMI. It is a little bit complicated than NAT Gateway.

### How to set a NAT Gateway

it's easy to set up a NAT Gateway than NAT Instance.

### Virtual Private Gateway
A virtual private gateway is the VPN endpoint on the Amazon side of your Site-to-Site VPN connection that can be attached to a single VPC.

## 18/26 NAT Gateway

NAT Gateway appears again. 

## 19/26 Textract is enough

Rekognition is for pre-trained. this means you need to train the model for your own use case.

## 20/26 DynamoDB TTL
ttl is easy to set up, and others need more development.
