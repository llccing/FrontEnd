## Amazon Cognito

Implement a secure, scalable, and customized sign-up and sign-in experience in minutes.

Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, access control, and brokered AWS service access to your web and mobile applications within minutes. It is a developer-centric, cost-effective service that provides secure, tenant-based identity stores and federation options that can scale to millions of users. Amazon Cognito helps you create branded customer experiences, improve security, and adapt to your customers’ needs. For example, it supports login with social identity providers and passwordless login using WebAuthn passkeys or SMS and email one-time-passwords. Amazon Cognito supports various compliance standards, operates on open identity standards, and integrates with an extensive catalogue of development resources and SDK libraries.

With Amazon Cognito, you can focus on creating great app experiences instead of worrying about building, securing, and scaling a solution to handle user management and authentication.

## Cognito user pools

An Amazon Cognito user pool is a user directory for web and mobile app authentication and authorization. From the perspective of your app, an Amazon Cognito user pool is an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider (IdP). A user pool adds layers of additional features for security, identity federation, app integration, and customization of the user experience.

You can, for example, verify that your users’ sessions are from trusted sources. You can combine the Amazon Cognito directory with an external identity provider. With your preferred AWS SDK, you can choose the API authorization model that works best for your app. And you can add AWS Lambda functions that modify or overhaul the default behavior of Amazon Cognito.
