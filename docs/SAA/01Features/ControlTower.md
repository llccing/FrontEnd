## AWS Control Tower

Set up and govern a secure, multi-account AWS environment.

AWS Control Tower offers the easiest way to set up and govern a secure, multi-account AWS environment. It establishes a landing zone that is based on best-practices blueprints, and it enables governance using controls you can choose from a pre-packaged list. The landing zone is a well-architected, multi-account baseline that follows AWS best practices. Controls implement governance rules for security, compliance, and operations.
