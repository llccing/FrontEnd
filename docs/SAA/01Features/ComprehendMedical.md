### What can I do with Amazon Comprehend Medical?

You can use the extracted medical information and their relationships to build applications for use cases, like clinical decision support, revenue cycle management (medical coding), and clinical trial management. Because Comprehend Medical is HIPAA eligible and can quickly identify protected health information (PHI), such as name, age, and medical record number, you can also use it to create applications that securely process, maintain, and transmit PHI.

Please note. When using Amazon Comprehend Medical to identify protected health information, please recall that the service provides confidence scores that indicate the level of confidence in the accuracy of the extracted entities. You should evaluate these confidence scores and identify the right confidence threshold for your use case. For specific compliance use cases, we recommend you use additional human review or other methods to confirm the accuracy of extracted PHI.
