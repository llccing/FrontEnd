## Amazon ElastiCache

Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that streamlines deployment and running of Valkey, Memcached, or Redis OSS protocol-compliant caches in the cloud. ElastiCache improves application performance by allowing you to retrieve information from a fast, managed, in-memory system instead of relying on slower disk-based systems. The service simplifies and offloads the management, monitoring, and operation of in-memory environments, enabling your engineering resources to focus on developing applications. Using ElastiCache, you can not only improve load and response times to user actions and queries but also reduce the cost associated with scaling web applications.

ElastiCache automates common administrative tasks required to operate a distributed in-memory key-value environment. Using ElastiCache, you can add a caching or in-memory layer to your application architecture in a matter of minutes with a few steps in the AWS Management Console. ElastiCache is designed to automatically maintain high availability, and provides a 99.99% availability Service Level Agreement (SLA). ElastiCache is protocol compliant with Valkey, Memcached, and Redis OSS, so code, applications, and popular tools that you use today with your existing Valeky, Memcached, or Redis OSS environments will seamlessly work with the service. There are no up-front investments required, and you pay only for the resources you use.
