## S3

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides management features so that you can optimize, organize, and configure access to your data to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.

### S3 Transfer Acceleration

Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration can speed up content transfers to and from Amazon S3 by as much as 50-500% for long-distance transfer of larger objects. Customers who have either web or mobile applications with widespread users or applications hosted far away from their S3 bucket can experience long and variable upload and download speeds over the Internet. S3 Transfer Acceleration (S3TA) reduces the variability in Internet routing, congestion and speeds that can affect transfers, and logically shortens the distance to S3 for remote applications. S3TA improves transfer performance by routing traffic through Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed Edge Locations and over AWS backbone networks, and by using network protocol optimizations. You can turn on S3TA with a few clicks in the S3 console, and test its benefits from your location with a speed comparison tool. With S3TA, you pay only for transfers that are accelerated.

### Bucket

要向 Amazon S3 上传数据（照片、视频、文档等），您必须首先在其中一个 AWS 区域 中创建 S3 存储桶。存储桶是 Amazon S3 中用于存储对象的容器。您可以在存储桶中存储任意数量的对象，并且账户中最多可以有 100 个存储桶。要查看存储桶利用率、存储桶配额或请求增加配额，请访问服务配额控制台。

Amazon S3 支持全局存储桶，这意味着每个存储桶名称在分区内的所有AWS 区域中所有AWS 账户内都必须是唯一的。分区是一组区域。AWS 目前有三个分区：aws（标准区域）、aws-cn（中国区域）和 aws-us-gov（AWS GovCloud (US)）。
