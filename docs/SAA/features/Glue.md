## AWS Glue

AWS Glue is a serverless, scalable data integration service that makes it easier to discover, prepare, move, and integrate data from multiple sources for analytics, machine learning, and application development. AWS Glue provides all the capabilities needed for data integration, so you can gain insights and put your data to use in minutes instead of months.
