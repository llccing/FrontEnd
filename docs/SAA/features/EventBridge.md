## AWS EventBridge

Amazon EventBridge is a service that provides real-time access to changes in data in AWS services, your own applications, and software as a service (SaaS) applications without writing code.

To get started, you can choose an event source on the EventBridge console. You can then select a target from AWS services including AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), and Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. EventBridge will automatically deliver the events in near real-time.
