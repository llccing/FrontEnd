## AWS Macie

Amazon Macie is a data security service that discovers sensitive data using machine learning and pattern matching, provides visibility into data security risks, and enables automated protection against those risks.

### What are the key benefits of Macie?

Macie uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover sensitive data at scale in a cost-efficient way. Macie automatically detects a large and growing list of sensitive data types, including personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, and credit card numbers. It also gives you constant visibility of your data stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Macieâ€™s setup is simplified with one selection in the AWS Management Console or a single API call. Macie provides multi-account support using AWS Organizations, so you can enable Macie across all of your accounts with a few selections.
