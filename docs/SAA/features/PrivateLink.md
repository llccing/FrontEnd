## AWS PrivateLink

Establish connectivity between VPCs and AWS services without exposing data to the internet.

AWS PrivateLink lets users access services and resources hosted on AWS in a highly available and scalable manner, while keeping all network traffic within the AWS network. Users can privately access services and resources from their Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or on premises, without using public IPs, and without requiring traffic to traverse across the internet. Service owners can register their Network Load Balancers to PrivateLink services in order to provide their services to other AWS customers. Resource owners can share their resources directly without using Network Load Balancers.
