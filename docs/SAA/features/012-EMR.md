## Amazon EMR

Amazon EMR is the industry-leading cloud big data platform for data processing, interactive analysis, and machine learning using open source frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and Presto. With EMR you can run petabyte-scale analysis at less than half of the cost of traditional on-premises solutions and over 1.7x faster than standard Apache Spark.
