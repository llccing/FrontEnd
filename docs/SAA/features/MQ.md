## Amazon MQ

Fully managed service for open-source message brokers.

Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers in the cloud. You can directly access the ActiveMQ console, RabbitMQ console, industry standard APIs and protocols for messaging, including JMS, NMS, AMQP 0.9.1, AMQP 1.0, STOMP, MQTTv3, and WebSocket. You can create a new Amazon MQ broker using these standards with a few steps, or migrate existing message brokers to Amazon MQ without rewriting messaging code.
