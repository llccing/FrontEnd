## Amazon Aurora

Amazon Aurora is a modern relational database service offering performance and high availability at scale, fully open-source MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible editions, and a range of developer tools for building serverless and machine learning (ML)-driven applications.

Aurora features a distributed, fault-tolerant, and self-healing storage system that is decoupled from compute resources and auto-scales up to 128 TiB per database instance. It delivers high performance and availability with up to 15 low-latency read replicas, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and replication across three Availability Zones (AZs).

Aurora is also a fully managed service that automates time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups while providing the security, availability, and reliability of commercial databases at one-tenth of the cost.
