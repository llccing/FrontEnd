## Amazon DynamoDB

Serverless, NoSQL, fully managed database with single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.

DynamoDB is a fast and flexible nonrelational database service for any scale. DynamoDB enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling distributed databases to AWS so that they donâ€™t have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, throughput capacity planning, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling.

### Backup and Restore

DynamoDB offers on-demand backups and point-in-time recovery (PITR) backups to help protect your DynamoDB data from disaster events and offers data archiving for long-term retention. You can back up tables from a few megabytes to hundreds of terabytes of data, with no impact on performance and availability to your production applications. All backups are automatically encrypted, cataloged, and easily discoverable.

With on-demand backups, you can create a snapshot backup of your table that DynamoDB stores and manages. You're charged based on the size and duration of your backups. Using on-demand backup, you can restore your entire DynamoDB table to the exact state it was in when the backup was created.

### DynamoDB Global Table use cases
You can evacuate a Region (move away some or all requests going to that Region) should the Region have degraded performance or a full outage, with a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) measured in seconds. Using global tables also increases the DynamoDB SLA from 99.99% to 99.999%.
