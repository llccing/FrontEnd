## AWS Organizations

AWS Organizations helps you centrally govern your environment as you scale your workloads on AWS. Whether you are a growing startup or a large enterprise, Organizations helps you to programmatically create new accounts and allocate resources, simplify billing by setting up a single payment method for all of your accounts, create groups of accounts to organize your workflows, and apply policies to these groups for governance. In addition, AWS Organizations is integrated with other AWS services so you can define central configurations, security mechanisms, and resource sharing across accounts in your organization.
