## AWS Backup

Centrally manage and automate data protection.

AWS Backup is a fully managed service that centralizes and automates data protection across AWS services like Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Amazon FSx, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), and hybrid workloads like VMware on premises, VMware Cloud on AWS, and VMware Cloud on AWS Outposts. AWS Backup offers a cost-effective, fully managed, policy-based service that further simplifies data protection at scale. Using the AWS Backup Audit Manager, you can audit and report on the compliance of your data protection policies to help meet your business and regulatory needs. Together with AWS Organizations, use AWS Backup to centrally deploy data protection policies to configure, manage, and govern your backup activities across your AWS accounts and resources.
