## Amazon RDS Proxy

Make your applications more scalable, resilient, and secure.

RDS Proxy is a fully-managed, highly available, and easy-to-use database proxy feature of Amazon RDS that enables your applications to: 1) improve scalability by pooling and sharing database connections; 2) improve availability by reducing database failover times by up to 66% and preserving application connections during failovers; and 3) improve security by optionally enforcing AWS IAM authentication to databases and securely storing credentials in AWS Secrets Manager.

### How can I enable RDS Proxy?

You enable RDS Proxy for your Amazon RDS database with just a few clicks on the Amazon RDS console. While enabling RDS Proxy, you specify the VPC and subnets you want to access RDS Proxy from. As a Lambda user, you can enable RDS Proxy for your Amazon RDS database and set up a Lambda function to access it with just a few clicks and without leaving the Lambda console.
