DAX does all the heavy lifting required to add in-memory acceleration to your DynamoDB tables, without requiring developers to manage cache invalidation, data population, or cluster management. As DAX is compatible with existing DynamoDB API calls, no application logic modification is required. Similar to DynamoDB, you only pay for the capacity you provision. You can focus on building great applications for your customers without worrying about performance at scale.",-1)])])}const m=o(n,[["render",c]]),s=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/SAA/01Features/DynamoDBAccelerator.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212680000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"8dc20e2f1b4b500b4a8b691792c2c9b3c12addca","time":1768212680000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Merge pull request #66 from llccing/copilot/fix-vite-build-error"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/SAA/01Features/DynamoDBAccelerator.md"}');export{m as comp,s as data};
