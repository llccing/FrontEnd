That will be up to your application to do.</p><p>Overloading some instances is a thing that can happen with sticky sessions, if most of your users that happen to be stuck to a specific instance come on at the same time, only that instance will get any traffic. Or if you scale up, the new instances will not get much traffic since everyone is stuck to the old instances.</p><p>This problem is the same with all load balancer types.</p><p>The better way to handle sessions is to have your application instances be stateless. Store the session data in a shared database instead.

In this model, the account that owns the VPC (owner) shares one or more subnets with other accounts (participants) that belong to the same organization from AWS Organizations. After a subnet is shared, the participants can view, create, modify, and delete their application resources in the subnets shared with them. Participants cannot view, modify, or delete resources that belong to other participants or the VPC owner.</p><h2 id="_20-20-auto-scaling-on-the-rds-for-oracle-instance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_20-20-auto-scaling-on-the-rds-for-oracle-instance"><span>20/20 Auto Scaling on the RDS for Oracle instance.</span></a></h2><p>The Aurora would not be able to replace Oracle as it uses Oracle-specific PL/SQL functions.</p>',61)])])}const h=a(o,[["render",r]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/SAA/03PreExams/004-250119.html","title":"Result","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212945000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"510851a2e40013ba249eb2696f9e38f188ca533a","time":1768212945000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Update README.md"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/SAA/03PreExams/004-250119.md"}');export{h as comp,p as data};
