What is Fine-Tuning in Amazon Bedrock?</strong> Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained Foundation Model (FM) and training it further on a smaller, specific dataset to adapt it to a specific task or domain. To do this successfully, you must provide the model with examples of how it should behave.</p><p><strong>2. Why Option A is Correct:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Fine-tuning in Amazon Bedrock is a supervised learning process. You must show the model existing questions (inputs) and the correct answers (outputs).</li><li><strong>Data Structure:</strong> The standard requirement for fine-tuning text models in Bedrock is to provide a dataset in <strong>JSONL (JSON Lines)</strong> format. Each line in this dataset represents a training record containing a <strong>prompt</strong> (the input text) and a <strong>completion</strong> (the desired output text).</li><li><strong>Result:</strong> By providing these labeled pairs, the model learns the specific patterns, tone, and information contained in the company&#39;s data, achieving the goal of making the tool more accurate.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Why the other options are incorrect:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>B. Prepare the training dataset by creating a .txt file that contains multiple lines in .csv format.</strong></p><ul><li>This is incorrect because of the file format. Amazon Bedrock fine-tuning requires data in <strong>JSONL</strong> format, not a text file mimicking CSV. While the data inside might be similar conceptually, the technical file definition is wrong.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>C. Purchase Provisioned Throughput for Amazon Bedrock.</strong></p><ul><li>This is a <strong>deployment</strong> requirement, not a clear &quot;strategy to fine-tune.&quot; While it is true that to <em>use</em> (run inference on) a custom fine-tuned model in Bedrock you must purchase Provisioned Throughput, purchasing the throughput does not perform the training itself. The question asks how to make the model more accurate using data, not how to pay for hosting it.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>D. Train the model on journals and textbooks.</strong></p><ul><li>This is incorrect because the specific requirement is to use <strong>&quot;the company&#39;s data.&quot;</strong> Training on general journals and textbooks is known as &quot;Continued Pre-training&quot; or general domain adaptation, but it does not utilize the specific proprietary data the company wants to use to improve the specific search tool.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="summary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary"><span><strong>Summary</strong></span></a></h3><p>To fine-tune a model effectively using company data, you must create a dataset that teaches the model exactly what to do. This is done by providing <strong>labeled data</strong> formatted with <strong>inputs (prompts)</strong> and <strong>outputs (completions)</strong>.</p>',12)])])}const c=e(i,[["render",r]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/019-train.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212945000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"510851a2e40013ba249eb2696f9e38f188ca533a","time":1768212945000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Update README.md"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/019-train.md"}');export{c as comp,d as data};
