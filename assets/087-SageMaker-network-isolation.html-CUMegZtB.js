When this is enabled: SageMaker provisions the container (where the model training or inference code runs) without any network access to the outside world. The container cannot make API calls to other AWS services or access the internet. This capability is designed specifically for high-security and compliance scenarios where algorithms must run in an "air-gapped" manner to prevent data leakage.',-1),e("p",null,"Why the other options are incorrect:",-1),e("p",null,"A. SageMaker Experiments: This is a feature used to track, organize, and compare machine learning iterations (metrics, hyperparameters, etc.). It helps manage the ML lifecycle but has nothing to do with network security or blocking internet access. C. Encrypt data at rest: While encryption is vital for compliance, it protects the data while it is stored on disk (confidentiality). It does not prevent the running container from connecting to the internet or transmitting unencrypted data if a connection were available. D. IAM Roles: IAM roles control permissions (what AWS resources the job is allowed to access). However, an IAM role alone does not restrict network paths. Even with a restrictive IAM role, if the network configuration allows internet access, the container could still technically reach public endpoints (even if AWS API calls fail). Network isolation is required to physically (virtually) sever the connection.",-1)])])}const l=n(r,[["render",o]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/087-SageMaker-network-isolation.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212945000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"510851a2e40013ba249eb2696f9e38f188ca533a","time":1768212945000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Update README.md"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/087-SageMaker-network-isolation.md"}');export{l as comp,h as data};
