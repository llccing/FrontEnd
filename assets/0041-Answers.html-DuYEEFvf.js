A gateway VPC endpoint is a network gateway that allows communication between instances in a VPC and a service, such as Amazon S3, without requiring an Internet gateway or a NAT device. Data transfer between the VPC and the service through a gateway VPC endpoint is free of charge, while data transfer between the VPC and the Internet through an Internet gateway or NAT device is subject to data transfer charges. By using a gateway VPC endpoint, the company can reduce its data transfer costs by eliminating the need to transfer data through the NAT gateway to access Amazon S3. This option would provide the required connectivity to Amazon S3 and minimize data transfer charges.</p><h2 id="q43" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q43"><span>Q43</span></a></h2><p><strong>Answer:</strong> B</p><p>A: VPN also goes through the internet and uses the bandwidth C: daily Snowball transfer is not really a long-term solution when it comes to cost and efficiency D: S3 limits don&#39;t change anything here</p><hr><p>Option B (correct). Establish a new AWS Direct Connect connection and direct backup traffic through this new connection.</p><p>AWS Direct Connect is a network service that allows you to establish a dedicated network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS. This connection bypasses the public Internet and can provide more reliable, lower-latency communication between your on-premises application and Amazon S3. By directing backup traffic through the AWS Direct Connect connection, you can minimize the impact on your internet bandwidth and ensure timely backups to S3.</p><h2 id="q44" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q44"><span>Q44</span></a></h2><p><strong>Answer:</strong> AB</p><p>The correct solution is AB, as you can see here:</p><p>https://aws.amazon.com/it/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-audit-deleted-missing-objects/</p><p>It states the following:</p><p>To prevent or mitigate future accidental deletions, consider the following features:</p><p>Enable versioning to keep historical versions of an object.

Reserved instances require a fixed one-year or three-year commitment. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html#capacity-reservations-differences</p><hr><p><em><strong>CORRECT</strong></em> Option D. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region and three Availability Zones needed.</p><p>An On-Demand Capacity Reservation is a type of Amazon EC2 reservation that enables you to create and manage reserved capacity on Amazon EC2. With an On-Demand Capacity Reservation, you can specify the Region and Availability Zones where you want to reserve capacity, and the number of EC2 instances you want to reserve. This allows you to guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones in a specific Region.</p><p><em><strong>WRONG</strong></em> Option A, purchasing Reserved Instances that specify the Region needed, would not guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones. Option B, creating an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region needed, would not guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones. Option C, purchasing Reserved Instances that specify the Region and three Availability Zones needed, would not guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones as Reserved Instances do not provide capacity reservations.</p><h2 id="q48" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q48"><span>Q48</span></a></h2><p><strong>Answer:</strong> D</p><p>durable chinese version: 耐用的, 持久的 keyword is &quot;durable&quot; location A and B is ephemeral storage C takes forever so is not HA, that leaves D</p><h2 id="q49" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q49"><span>Q49</span></a></h2><p><strong>Answer:</strong> B</p><p>I think the answer is B: Users access the files randomly</p><p>S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period.
