Integrates a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow: This is incorrect. RAG workflows are typically associated with Large Language Models (LLMs) and services like Amazon Bedrock or specific implementations using SageMaker JumpStart and vector databases (like Amazon OpenSearch). Clarify is not an orchestration tool for RAG. B. Monitors the quality of ML models in production: This is partially true but imprecise. Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor is the specific service used to monitor model quality (data drift, model quality). While Clarify integrates with Model Monitor to check for bias drift, the general act of "monitoring quality" is the domain of Model Monitor. Option D is the specific definition of what Clarify does independently. C. Documents critical details about ML models: This is incorrect.
