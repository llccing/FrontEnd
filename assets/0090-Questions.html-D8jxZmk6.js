The company wants to provide secure access to this bucket from the application tier running on Amazon EC2 instances inside a VPC. Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to accomplish this? (Choose two.)</p><p>A. Configure a VPC gateway endpoint for Amazon S3 within the VPC. B. Create a bucket policy to make the objects in the S3 bucket public. C. Create a bucket policy that limits access to only the application tier running in the VPC. D. Create an IAM user with an S3 access policy and copy the IAM credentials to the EC2 instance. E.

The company is migrating the application to AWS to increase the application&#39;s elasticity and availability. The current architecture shows heavy read activity on the database during times of normal operation. Every 4 hours, the company&#39;s development team pulls a full export of the production database to populate a database in the staging environment. During this period, users experience unacceptable application latency. The development team is unable to use the staging environment until the procedure completes. A solutions architect must recommend replacement architecture that alleviates the application latency issue. The replacement architecture also must give the development team the ability to continue using the staging environment without delay. Which solution meets these requirements?</p><p>A. Use Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas for production. Populate the staging database by implementing a backup and restore process that uses the mysqldump utility. B. Use Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas for production. Use database cloning to create the staging database on-demand. C. Use Amazon RDS for MySQL with a Multi-AZ deployment and read replicas for production. Use the standby instance for the staging database. D. Use Amazon RDS for MySQL with a Multi-AZ deployment and read replicas for production.

After a user uploads a file, the file requires one-time simple processing to transform the data and save the data in JSON format for later analysis. Each file must be processed as quickly as possible after it is uploaded. Demand will vary. On some days, users will upload a high number of files. On other days, users will upload a few files or no files. Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?</p><p>A. Configure Amazon EMR to read text files from Amazon S3. Run processing scripts to transform the data. Store the resulting JSON file in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster. B. Configure Amazon S3 to send an event notification to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use Amazon EC2 instances to read from the queue and process the data. Store the resulting JSON file in Amazon DynamoDB. C. Configure Amazon S3 to send an event notification to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use an AWS Lambda function to read from the queue and process the data. Store the resulting JSON file in Amazon DynamoDB. D.

The application uploads the images into an Amazon S3 bucket. The company has set up S3 event notifications to publish the object creation events to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue. The SQS queue serves as the event source for an AWS Lambda function that processes the images and sends the results to users through email. Users report that they are receiving multiple email messages for every uploaded image. A solutions architect determines that SQS messages are invoking the Lambda function more than once, resulting in multiple email messages. What should the solutions architect do to resolve this issue with the LEAST operational overhead?</p><p>A. Set up long polling in the SQS queue by increasing the ReceiveMessage wait time to 30 seconds. B. Change the SQS standard queue to an SQS FIFO queue. Use the message deduplication ID to discard duplicate messages. C. Increase the visibility timeout in the SQS queue to a value that is greater than the total of the function timeout and the batch window timeout. D.
