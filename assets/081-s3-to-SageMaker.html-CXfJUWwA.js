S3 VPC Endpoint: A VPC Endpoint (specifically a Gateway Endpoint for S3) allows the SageMaker resources inside the VPC to connect directly to S3 without the traffic going over the public internet.

Use Amazon Inspector: Amazon Inspector is used for vulnerability management (scanning for software vulnerabilities and network exposure). It does not manage data transfer or network routing between services. B. Use Amazon Macie: Amazon Macie is a data security service that discovers sensitive data (like PII) inside S3 buckets. While it monitors the content of the data for privacy reasons, it does not manage the flow or network connectivity between S3 and SageMaker. D. Configure SageMaker to use S3 Glacier Deep Archive: S3 Glacier Deep Archive is a storage class for long-term archiving. Data retrieval takes up to 12 hours.
