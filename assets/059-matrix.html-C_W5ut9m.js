The AI practitioner now wants to measure the model performance Which metric will help the AI practitioner evaluate the performance of the model? A.Confusion matrix B.Correlation matrix C.R2 score D.Mean squared error （MSE）</p><p>The correct answer is A. Confusion matrix.</p><p>Here is the detailed explanation for why this is the correct answer and why the other options are incorrect for this specific scenario.</p><p>The Context: Classification vs. Regression To choose the right metric, you first must identify the type of machine learning task. This problem describes classifying types of materials (e.g., plastic, wood, metal). This is a Classification task, where the output is a discrete label/category.</p><p>Analysis of Options</p><p>A. Confusion matrix (Correct Answer) What it is: A table that summarizes the performance of a classification model. It shows exactly how many times the model predicted a category correctly and which specific categories it confused with others (e.g., how many times &quot;plastic&quot; was incorrectly classified as &quot;glass&quot;). Why it is correct: Since the AI practitioner is building a classification model, a confusion matrix is the standard tool to visualize performance. From a confusion matrix, you can derive other classification metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.</p><p>B. Correlation matrix What it is: A table showing correlation coefficients between different variables in a dataset. It measures the strength of a linear relationship between two variables (usually between -1 and 1). Why it is incorrect: A correlation matrix is used during the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) or Feature Engineering phase to see how variables relate to one another. It does not measure how well a model is performing its predictions.</p><p>C. R2 score (R-Squared) What it is: Also known as the &quot;Coefficient of Determination,&quot; it measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. Why it is incorrect: R2 is strictly a Regression metric. It is used when the model is trying to predict a continuous numerical value (like the price of a house or the temperature), not a category or label.</p><p>D. Mean squared error (MSE) What it is: It calculates the average of the squares of the errors—the difference between the actual value and the predicted value. Why it is incorrect: Like the R2 score, MSE is a Regression metric. It measures &quot;how far off&quot; a numerical prediction is. In classification (like identifying materials), there is no concept of being &quot;mathematically close&quot; to the right label; you are either right or wrong. Therefore, MSE is not appropriate here.</p><p>Summary Table for your Exam:</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">Metric</th><th style="text-align:left;">Task Type</th><th style="text-align:left;">Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Confusion Matrix</td><td style="text-align:left;">Classification</td><td style="text-align:left;">Comparing predicted labels vs. actual labels.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">MSE / R2 Score</td><td style="text-align:left;">Regression</td><td style="text-align:left;">Measuring error in numerical predictions.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Correlation Matrix</td><td style="text-align:left;">Data Analysis</td><td style="text-align:left;">Seeing how two variables relate to each other.</td></tr></tbody></table>',11)])])}const c=t(o,[["render",s]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/059-matrix.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212680000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"8dc20e2f1b4b500b4a8b691792c2c9b3c12addca","time":1768212680000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Merge pull request #66 from llccing/copilot/fix-vite-build-error"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/059-matrix.md"}');export{c as comp,h as data};
