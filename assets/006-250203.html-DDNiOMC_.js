Here&#39;s why:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Real-time Data Ingestion</strong>: Amazon Kinesis Firehose is designed for real-time data ingestion, which is crucial for tracking high scores in a video game where multiple players are scoring simultaneously.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reliable and Scalable</strong>: Kinesis Firehose allows you to easily collect and process large streams of data in real time, making it suitable for applications that rely on up-to-date information from millions of players.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stream Processing</strong>: Kinesis allows for various types of streaming and processing of data. In this case, it would effectively facilitate the integration of real-time scores into the datastore.</p></li></ol><p>In contrast, here’s a brief overview of the other options:</p><ul><li><p><strong>AWS Data Pipeline</strong> (A): It&#39;s more oriented towards batch processing of data, not real-time ingestion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Amazon DynamoDB Streams</strong> (C): While it allows capturing changes to items in a DynamoDB table, it doesn&#39;t handle real-time ingestion from external sources directly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Amazon Elasticsearch Service</strong> (D): This is primarily used for search and analytics. It is not a direct ingestion service but can receive data from Kinesis or other sources.</p></li></ul><p>So, Kinesis Firehose is best suited for this specific requirement of real-time data ingestion from a video game application.</p><h2 id="_4-23-alb-sqs-asg" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-23-alb-sqs-asg"><span>4/23 ALB, SQS, ASG</span></a></h2><p>don&#39;t need to use spare CPU available of instance. just use instances of ASG to read from the SQS queue.</p><h2 id="_5-23-using-lambda-function-to-access-an-amazon-rds-database" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-23-using-lambda-function-to-access-an-amazon-rds-database"><span>5/23 Using Lambda function to access an Amazon RDS database</span></a></h2><p>you use a Lambda function to write data to an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database through RDS Proxy.

This pairing is generally ideal for applications requiring automatic scaling.</p><p>B. <strong>Amazon Cognito and Amazon DynamoDB</strong>: <strong>Amazon Cognito</strong> is focused on user authentication and management, while <strong>DynamoDB</strong> is a NoSQL database service. Although both are part of the AWS toolkit, this combination doesn&#39;t directly address the requirement for an application layer designed around serverless execution and request handling.</p><p>C. <strong>Amazon DynamoDB and AWS CodeDeploy</strong>: <strong>DynamoDB</strong> is again involved as the database solution, but <strong>AWS CodeDeploy</strong> is primarily for deploying code to EC2 instances or serverless backends. This choice also doesn&#39;t align with the serverless needs of the application layer.</p><p>D. <strong>AWS Lambda and an Application Load Balancer</strong>: While <strong>AWS Lambda</strong> is indeed a serverless component, an <strong>Application Load Balancer</strong> is typically used for distributing incoming application traffic across multiple targets (like EC2 instances). It may not fully align with a purely serverless model as you might deploy Lambda functions behind an API Gateway instead.</p><p>The most appropriate answer is generally <strong>A</strong> (Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda) when considering standard serverless architecture that needs to scale automatically and handle variable request volumes. Thus, if you chose <strong>D</strong> as your answer, it may not have met the core requirement of being entirely serverless in the application layer (as the Application Load Balancer introduces a level of management and server-based scaling).</p><p>Therefore, the reason your answer was marked incorrect is because option A better fits the specific needs of the scenario provided.</p><h2 id="_19-23-weighted-routing-policy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_19-23-weighted-routing-policy"><span>19/23 Weighted Routing policy</span></a></h2><p>when Blue-Green deployment, use weighted routing policy.</p><h2 id="_20-23-cloudtrail-with-data-events" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_20-23-cloudtrail-with-data-events"><span>20/23 CloudTrail with data events.</span></a></h2><p>CloudTrail with management events does not provide granular audit logging.</p><h2 id="_21-23-configure-the-database-security-group-to-allow-database-traffic-from-the-applicatoin-server-security-group" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_21-23-configure-the-database-security-group-to-allow-database-traffic-from-the-applicatoin-server-security-group"><span>21/23 Configure the database security group to allow database traffic from the applicatoin server security group.</span></a></h2><p>ACLs are stateless and the ACLs should be configured on Web and DB subnet to allow outgoing and incoming traffic to each other.</p><h2 id="_22-23-how-can-i-encrypt-an-unencrypted-amazon-rds-db-instance-for-mysql-or-mariadb-with-minimal-downtime" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_22-23-how-can-i-encrypt-an-unencrypted-amazon-rds-db-instance-for-mysql-or-mariadb-with-minimal-downtime"><span>22/23 How can I encrypt an unencrypted Amazon RDS DB instance for MySQL or MariaDB with minimal downtime?</span></a></h2><ul><li>Create a snapshot of the unencrypted DB instance.</li><li>Restore the encrypted DB instance from the snapshot.</li><li>Modify the DB instance to use the new encryption.</li></ul><h2 id="_23-23-athena-and-s3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_23-23-athena-and-s3"><span>23/23 Athena and S3</span></a></h2><p>Athena is a serverless query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.</p>',61)])])}const l=e(i,[["render",o]]),c=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/SAA/03PreExams/006-250203.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212945000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"510851a2e40013ba249eb2696f9e38f188ca533a","time":1768212945000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Update README.md"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/SAA/03PreExams/006-250203.md"}');export{l as comp,c as data};
