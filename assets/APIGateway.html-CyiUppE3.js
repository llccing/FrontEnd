With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can create an API that acts as a “front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services, such as applications running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) or AWS Elastic Beanstalk, code running on AWS Lambda, or any web application. Amazon API Gateway handles all of the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management. Amazon API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs. For HTTP APIs and REST APIs, you pay only for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out. For WebSocket APIs, you pay only for messages sent and received and for the time a user/device is connected to the WebSocket API.</p><h3 id="can-i-create-https-endpoints" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#can-i-create-https-endpoints"><span>Can I create HTTPS endpoints?</span></a></h3><p>Yes, all of the APIs created with Amazon API Gateway expose HTTPS endpoints only. Amazon API Gateway does not support unencrypted (HTTP) endpoints. By default, Amazon API Gateway assigns an internal domain to the API that automatically uses the Amazon API Gateway certificate. When configuring your APIs to run under a custom domain name, you can provide your own certificate for the domain.</p><h3 id="lambda-authorizer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lambda-authorizer"><span>Lambda authorizer</span></a></h3><p>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-use-lambda-authorizer.html</p><p>Use a Lambda authorizer (formerly known as a custom authorizer) to control access to your API. When a client makes a request your API&#39;s method, API Gateway calls your Lambda authorizer. The Lambda authorizer takes the caller&#39;s identity as the input and returns an IAM policy as the output.</p><p>Use a Lambda authorizer to implement a custom authorization scheme. Your scheme can use request parameters to determine the caller&#39;s identity or use a bearer token authentication strategy such as OAuth or SAML. Create a Lambda authorizer in the API Gateway REST API console, using the AWS CLI, or an AWS SDK.</p>',8)])])}const m=e(s,[["render",r]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/SAA/01Features/APIGateway.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212945000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"510851a2e40013ba249eb2696f9e38f188ca533a","time":1768212945000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Update README.md"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/SAA/01Features/APIGateway.md"}');export{m as comp,u as data};
