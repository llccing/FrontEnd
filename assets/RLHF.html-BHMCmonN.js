This ranking considers factors like helpfulness and harmlessness, especially when prompts are designed to elicit harmful responses. Reward Model Training: A reward model is trained using the human preference data. This model learns to predict a preference score for a given prompt. Model Optimization: The original LLM is then optimized using reinforcement learning, guided by the reward model.
