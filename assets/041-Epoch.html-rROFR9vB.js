Decrease the batch size: While changing the batch size affects how the model updates its weights (smaller batches add noise which can help generalization), it is not the primary lever for directly increasing accuracy to a target level.

If the model hasn't reached the target accuracy yet, stopping earlier would result in lower accuracy (underfitting). D.

Increasing temperature makes the model's responses more random and creative, while decreasing it makes them more deterministic.
