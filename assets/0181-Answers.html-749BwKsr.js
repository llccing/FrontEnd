This is the way Lambda can get controlled access to resouces in your VPC.</p><p>Default Lambda Settings: When you create a Lambda function without specifying a VPC, the Lambda function does not get associated with any particular VPC. By default, Lambda functions are not deployed within a VPC and do not have access to resources within a VPC, such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, or Elasticache clusters, unless you explicitly configure the Lambda function to connect to a VPC.</p><hr><p>Update the route tables in the VPC to allow the Lambda function to access the on-premises data center through Direct Connect.</p><p>By updating the route tables in the VPC to allow the Lambda function to access the on-premises data center through Direct Connect, is the most appropriate solution. By updating the route tables, you can specify the route for traffic from the Lambda function to the IP address range of the on-premises data center via the Direct Connect connection. This ensures that the Lambda function can securely communicate with the database in the private subnet of the data center.</p><h2 id="q185" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q185"><span>Q185</span></a></h2><p><strong>Answer:</strong> B</p><p>B.
