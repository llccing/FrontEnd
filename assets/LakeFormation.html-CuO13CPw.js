With Lake Formation, you can centralize data security and governance using the AWS Glue Data Catalog, letting you manage metadata and data permissions in one place with familiar database-style features. It also delivers fine-grained data access control, so you can help ensure users have access to the right data, down to the row and column level. You can then scale permissions across your users. Lake Formation also makes it easier to share data internally across your organization, across Regions, and externally using AWS Data Exchange, letting you create a data mesh or meet other data sharing needs with no data movement.
