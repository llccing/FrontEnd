RTO is the maximum acceptable delay between the interruption of service and restoration of service. This determines what is considered an acceptable time window when service is unavailable.</p></li><li><p>Recovery Point Objective (RPO) Defined by the organization. RPO is the maximum acceptable amount of time since the last data recovery point. This determines what is considered an acceptable loss of data between the last recovery point and the interruption of service.</p></li></ul><h3 id="implementation-guidance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#implementation-guidance"><span>Implementation guidance</span></a></h3><ul><li><p>backup and restore (PRO in hours, RTO in 24 hours or less): : Back up your data and applications into the recovery Region. Using automated or continuous backups will permit point in time recovery (PITR), which can lower RPO to as low as 5 minutes in some cases. In the event of a disaster, you will deploy your infrastructure (using infrastructure as code to reduce RTO), deploy your code, and restore the backed-up data to recover from a disaster in the recovery Region.</p></li><li><p>Pilot light (RPO in minutes, RTO in tens of minutes): Provision a copy of your core workload infrastructure in the recovery Region. Replicate your data into the recovery Region and create backups of it there. Resources required to support data replication and backup, such as databases and object storage, are always on. Other elements such as application servers or serverless compute are not deployed, but can be created when needed with the necessary configuration and application code.</p></li><li><p>Warm standby (RPO in seconds, RTO in minutes): Maintain a scaled-down but fully functional version of your workload always running in the recovery Region. Business-critical systems are fully duplicated and are always on, but with a scaled down fleet. Data is replicated and live in the recovery Region. When the time comes for recovery, the system is scaled up quickly to handle the production load. The more scaled-up the warm standby is, the lower RTO and control plane reliance will be. When fully scales this is known as hot standby.</p></li><li><p>Multi-Region (multi-site) active-active (RPO near zero, RTO potentially zero): Your workload is deployed to, and actively serving traffic from, multiple AWS Regions. This strategy requires you to synchronize data across Regions. Possible conflicts caused by writes to the same record in two different regional replicas must be avoided or handled, which can be complex. Data replication is useful for data synchronization and will protect you against some types of disaster, but it will not protect you against data corruption or destruction unless your solution also includes options for point-in-time recovery.</p></li></ul>',6)])])}const l=a(r,[["render",s]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/SAA/01Features/DR.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212945000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"510851a2e40013ba249eb2696f9e38f188ca533a","time":1768212945000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Update README.md"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/SAA/01Features/DR.md"}');export{l as comp,d as data};
