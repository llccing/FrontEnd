Imagine a big global map, and you are dividing it into different areas (countries, regions). Each area has its own rules for where the traffic should go. You can think of it like guiding tourists to different parts of a large building based on which country they come from. Geoproximity Policy: Focus on the &quot;PROXIMITY&quot; between the user and the resources. Picture yourself as a navigator finding the shortest path between the user and the available resources on the map. The bias is like an adjustment to the magnetic field that slightly shifts how the &quot;closest&quot; is determined.</p><p>Associate with Real - World Examples Geolocation Policy: Link it to things like language preference or local regulations. Just as a restaurant in different countries may serve different cuisines based on local taste, a website can route traffic based on user location for targeted content. Geoproximity Policy: Connect it with scenarios where speed is of the essence, such as live - streaming events. You&#39;d want viewers to access the stream from the server that can deliver it the fastest, so proximity is key.</p><h2 id="_15-15" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_15-15"><span>15/15</span></a></h2><p>AWS Global Accelerator does not work with s3. again and again.</p><p>So for s3, just use CloudFront.</p>',43)])])}const c=a(n,[["render",i]]),l=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/SAA/03PreExams/0021-250323.html","title":"Result","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212945000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"510851a2e40013ba249eb2696f9e38f188ca533a","time":1768212945000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Update README.md"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/SAA/03PreExams/0021-250323.md"}');export{c as comp,l as data};
