The service can be set up with just a few clicks and scales automatically with your network traffic so you don&#39;t have to worry about deploying and managing any infrastructure. Network Firewall’s flexible rules engine lets you define firewall rules that give you fine-grained control over network traffic, such as blocking outbound Server Message Block (SMB) requests to prevent the spread of malicious activity. You can also import rules you’ve already written in common open source rule formats or import compatible rules sourced from AWS partners. AWS Network Firewall works together with AWS Firewall Manager so you can build policies based on AWS Network Firewall rules and then centrally apply those policies across your VPCs and accounts.</p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Network Firewall FAQs</a></p><h3 id="how-does-aws-network-firewall-protect-my-vpc" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-does-aws-network-firewall-protect-my-vpc"><span>How does AWS Network Firewall protect my VPC?</span></a></h3><p>AWS Network Firewall includes features that protect from common network threats. AWS Network Firewall’s stateful firewall can incorporate context from traffic flows, like tracking connections and protocol identification, to enforce policies such as preventing your VPCs from accessing domains using an unauthorized protocol. AWS Network Firewall’s intrusion prevention system (IPS) provides active traffic flow inspection so you can identify and block vulnerability exploits using signature-based detection. AWS Network Firewall also offers web filtering that can stop traffic to known-bad URLs and monitor fully qualified domain names.</p>',5)])])}const c=a(i,[["render",n]]),w=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/SAA/01Features/NetworkFirewall.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212945000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"510851a2e40013ba249eb2696f9e38f188ca533a","time":1768212945000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Update README.md"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/SAA/01Features/NetworkFirewall.md"}');export{c as comp,w as data};
