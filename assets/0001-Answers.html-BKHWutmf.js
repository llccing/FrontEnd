On a Snowball Edge device you can copy files with a speed of up to 100Gbps. 70TB will take around 5600 seconds, so very quickly, less than 2 hours. The downside is that it&#39;ll take between 4-6 working days to receive the device and then another 2-3 working days to send it back and for AWS to move the data onto S3 once it reaches them. Total time: 6-9 working days. Bandwidth used: 0.</p><p>C. File Gateway uses the Internet, so maximum speed will be at most 1Gbps, so it&#39;ll take a minimum of 6.5 days and you use 70TB of Internet bandwidth.</p><p>D. You can achieve speeds of up to 10Gbps with Direct Connect. Total time 15.5 hours and you will use 70TB of bandwidth. However, what&#39;s interesting is that the question does not specific what type of bandwidth? Direct Connect does not use your Internet bandwidth, as you will have a dedicate peer to peer connectivity between your on-prem and the AWS Cloud, so technically, you&#39;re not using your &quot;public&quot; bandwidth.</p><p>The requirements are a bit too vague but I think that B is the most appropriate answer, although D might also be correct if the bandwidth usage refers strictly to your public connectivity.</p><h3 id="what-s-nfs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-s-nfs"><span>what&#39;s NFS</span></a></h3><p>In the IT area, NFS stands for Network File System. It is a distributed file system protocol that allows users to access files over a network as if they were on a local disk. Here are some key points about NFS:</p><h4 id="key-features-of-nfs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#key-features-of-nfs"><span>Key Features of NFS</span></a></h4><ul><li><strong>File Sharing</strong>: Enables multiple users and systems to access the same files concurrently.</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Provides a seamless experience where remote files appear as if they are local.</li><li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: Works across various operating systems, making it versatile for mixed environments.</li><li><strong>Security</strong>: Supports authentication and permission settings to control access to files.</li><li><strong>Performance</strong>: Can be optimized with caching and other techniques to improve access speed.</li></ul><h4 id="use-cases" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-cases"><span>Use Cases</span></a></h4><ul><li><strong>Home Directories</strong>: Centralizing user directories across multiple machines.</li><li><strong>Data Sharing</strong>: Facilitating collaboration by sharing files among users in a network.</li><li><strong>Centralized Management</strong>: Simplifying data management by storing files in a single location.</li></ul><p>NFS is widely used in environments where file sharing and centralized storage are essential, such as in enterprises, educational institutions, and data centers.</p><h2 id="q7" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q7"><span>Q7</span></a></h2><p><strong>Answer:</strong> D D. Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) subscriptions. Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.</p><p>This solution uses Amazon SNS and SQS to publish and subscribe to messages respectively, which decouples the system and enables scalability by allowing multiple consumer applications to process the messages in parallel. Additionally, using Amazon SQS with multiple subscriptions can provide increased resiliency by allowing multiple copies of the same message to be processed in parallel.</p><h2 id="q8" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q8"><span>Q8</span></a></h2><p><strong>Answer:</strong> B</p><p>A - incorrect: Schedule scaling policy doesn&#39;t make sense. C, D - incorrect: Primary server should not be in same Auto Scaling group with compute nodes. B is correct.</p><h2 id="q9" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q9"><span>Q9</span></a></h2><p><strong>Answer:</strong> B</p><p>The same question and answer explanation exists in a Udemy course. Correct answer is B. Amazon S3 File Gateway provides a seamless way to connect to the cloud to store application data files and backup images as durable objects in Amazon S3 cloud storage. Amazon S3 File Gateway offers SMB or NFS-based access to data in Amazon S3 with local caching. It can be used for on-premises data-intensive Amazon EC2-based applications that need file protocol access to S3 object storage. Lifecycle policies can then transition the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days.</p><p>D is wrong because is involves too much extra configuration which is unnecessary.</p><h2 id="q10" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q10"><span>Q10</span></a></h2><p><strong>Answer:</strong> B</p><p>AnswerB - SQS FIFO queues ensure that messages are processed in the order they are received, which perfectly matches the requirement of maintaining order.</p>',43)])])}const l=a(o,[["render",i]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/SAA/02Examtopics/Questions/0001-Answers.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212945000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"510851a2e40013ba249eb2696f9e38f188ca533a","time":1768212945000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Update README.md"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/SAA/02Examtopics/Questions/0001-Answers.md"}');export{l as comp,h as data};
