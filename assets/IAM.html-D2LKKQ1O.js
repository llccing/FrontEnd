Each role has a set of permissions for making AWS service requests, and a role is not associated with a specific user or group. Instead, trusted entities such as identity providers or AWS services assume roles. For more information, see IAM roles.</p><h3 id="why-should-i-use-iam-roles" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-should-i-use-iam-roles"><span>Why should I use IAM roles?</span></a></h3><p>You should use IAM roles to grant access to your AWS accounts by relying on short-term credentials, a security best practice. Authorized identities, which can be AWS services or users from your identity provider, can assume roles to make AWS requests. To grant permissions to a role, attach an IAM policy to it. For more information, see Common scenarios for roles.</p><h3 id="what-are-iam-users-and-should-i-still-be-using-them" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-iam-users-and-should-i-still-be-using-them"><span>What are IAM users and should I still be using them?</span></a></h3><p>IAM users are identities with long-term credentials. You might be using IAM users for workforce users. In this case, AWS recommends using an identity provider and federating into AWS by assuming roles. You also can use roles to grant cross-account access to services and features such as AWS Lambda functions. In some scenarios, you might require IAM users with access keys that have long-term credentials with access to your AWS account. For these scenarios, AWS recommends using IAM access last used information to rotate credentials often and remove credentials that are not being used. For more information, see Overview of AWS identity management: Users.</p><h3 id="what-are-iam-policies" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-iam-policies"><span>What are IAM policies?</span></a></h3><p>IAM policies define permissions for the entities you attach them to. For example, to grant access to an IAM role, attach a policy to the role. The permissions defined in the policy determine whether requests are allowed or denied. You also can attach policies to some resources, such as Amazon S3 buckets, to grant direct, cross-account access. And you can attach policies to an AWS organization or organizational unit to restrict access across multiple accounts. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM role makes a request. For more information, see Identity-based policies.</p><h3 id="delegate-access-across-aws-accounts-using-iam-roles" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#delegate-access-across-aws-accounts-using-iam-roles"><span>Delegate access across AWS accounts using IAM roles</span></a></h3><p>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html</p><p>This tutorial teaches you how to use a role to delegate access to resources in different AWS accounts called Destination and Originating. You share resources in one account with users in a different account. By setting up cross-account access in this way, you don&#39;t have to create individual IAM users in each account. In addition, users don&#39;t have to sign out of one account and sign in to another account to access resources in different AWS accounts.</p><p>In this tutorial, the Destination account manages application data accessed by different applications and teams. In each account, you store application information in Amazon S3 buckets. You manage IAM users in the Originating account, where you have two IAM user roles: Developers and Analysts. Developers and Analysts use the Originating account to generate data shared by multiple microservices. Both roles have permissions to work in the Originating account and access resources there. From time to time, a developer must update the shared data in the Destination account. The developers store this data in an Amazon S3 bucket called amzn-s3-demo-bucket-shared-container.</p><p>At the end of this tutorial, you have the following:</p><ul><li>Users in the Originating account (the trusted account) allowed to assume a specific role in the Destination account.</li><li>A role in the Destination account (the trusting account) allowed to access a specific Amazon S3 bucket.</li><li>The amzn-s3-demo-bucket-shared-container bucket in the Destination account.</li></ul><h3 id="notaction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#notaction"><span>NotAction</span></a></h3><h4 id="notaction-with-deny" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#notaction-with-deny"><span>NotAction with Deny</span></a></h4><p>You can use the NotAction element in a statement with &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Deny&quot; to deny access to all of the listed resources except for the actions specified in the NotAction element. This combination does not allow the listed items, but instead explicitly denies the actions not listed. You must still allow actions that you want to allow.</p><p>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_notaction.html</p>',23)])])}const l=s(o,[["render",n]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/SAA/01Features/IAM.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212680000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"8dc20e2f1b4b500b4a8b691792c2c9b3c12addca","time":1768212680000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Merge pull request #66 from llccing/copilot/fix-vite-build-error"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/SAA/01Features/IAM.md"}');export{l as comp,u as data};
