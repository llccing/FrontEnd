AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL service that makes it easy to prepare and load your data for analytics.</p><p><a href="https://hevodata.com/learn/aws-glue-vs-aws-lambda-key-differences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Lambda vs AWS Glue: Key Differences</a></p><h4 id="when-should-we-use-aws-glue-or-aws-lambda" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#when-should-we-use-aws-glue-or-aws-lambda"><span>When should we use AWS Glue or AWS Lambda?</span></a></h4><ul><li>Complex ETL Workflows: If your data processing requires complex Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations, AWS Glue is the better choice. It offers built-in data cleansing, transformation, and cataloging tools, making it ideal for managing large-scale data pipelines.</li><li>Data Integration with Multiple Sources: AWS Glue is designed to seamlessly integrate with various data sources such as S3, RDS, Redshift, and external databases. If your workload involves combining and processing data from multiple sources, Glue’s data catalog and built-in connectors streamline this process.</li><li>Event-Driven Data Processing: AWS Lambda is ideal if your application needs to trigger data processing tasks based on specific events (e.g., file uploads and database changes). Lambda allows you to execute code responding to these events with minimal latency, making it suitable for real-time data processing.</li><li>Simple or Short-Lived Tasks: AWS Lambda is more appropriate for simple data transformation tasks or operations that can be completed within a few seconds. Lambda’s pay-per-use pricing model is cost-efficient for short-lived functions, making it perfect for lightweight processing tasks.</li></ul><h3 id="lambda-edge" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lambda-edge"><span>Lambda@Edge</span></a></h3><p>Lambda@Edge is a feature of Amazon CloudFront that lets you run code closer to users of your application, which improves performance and reduces latency. With Lambda@Edge, you don&#39;t have to provision or manage infrastructure in multiple locations around the world. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.</p><p>With Lambda@Edge, you can enrich your web applications by making them globally distributed and improving their performance — all with zero server administration. Lambda@Edge runs your code in response to events generated by the Amazon CloudFront content delivery network (CDN). Just upload your code to AWS Lambda, which takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability at an AWS location closest to your end user.</p><p>https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/</p><h3 id="config-a-lambda-function-to-connect-to-an-rds-instance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#config-a-lambda-function-to-connect-to-an-rds-instance"><span>config a lambda function to connect to an RDS instance</span></a></h3><p>https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/connect-lambda-to-an-rds-instance</p><p><strong>In the same VPC</strong></p><p>For instances that are attached to the same security group, make the security group the source for the inbound rule.
