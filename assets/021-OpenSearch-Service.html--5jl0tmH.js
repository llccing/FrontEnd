A.Integration with Amazon S3 for object storage B.Support for geospatial indexing and queries C.Scalable index management and nearest neighbor search capability D.Ability to perform real-time analysis on streaming data</p><p><strong>Correct answer: C. Scalable index management and nearest neighbor search capability</strong></p><p>To build <strong>vector database</strong> applications (e.g., semantic search, image/text similarity, RAG for GenAI), the key requirement is the ability to:</p><ul><li><strong>Store vector embeddings</strong> (high‑dimensional numeric arrays)</li><li>Run <strong>similarity search</strong> such as <strong>k‑nearest neighbors (k‑NN)</strong> / approximate nearest neighbor (ANN)</li><li>Scale indexing and query performance as data grows</li></ul><p><strong>Amazon OpenSearch Service</strong> supports this through its <strong>k‑NN / vector search capabilities</strong>, which provide <strong>nearest neighbor search</strong> over vectors and scalable index management—exactly what a vector database workload needs.</p><p>Why the others are not correct:</p><ul><li><strong>A. Integration with Amazon S3</strong>: useful for backups, snapshots, data lakes, etc., but <strong>doesn’t provide vector similarity search</strong>.</li><li><strong>B. Geospatial indexing and queries</strong>: supports location-based queries (distance, bounding box), <strong>not vector embedding similarity</strong>.</li><li><strong>D. Real-time analysis on streaming data</strong>: supports observability/log analytics, but streaming analytics <strong>is not the defining feature</strong> for vector DB apps.</li></ul><p>So, the feature enabling vector database applications is <strong>nearest neighbor search at scale</strong> → <strong>C</strong>.</p>",8)])])}const l=t(n,[["render",o]]),g=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/021-OpenSearch-Service.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212680000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"8dc20e2f1b4b500b4a8b691792c2c9b3c12addca","time":1768212680000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Merge pull request #66 from llccing/copilot/fix-vite-build-error"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/021-OpenSearch-Service.md"}');export{l as comp,g as data};
