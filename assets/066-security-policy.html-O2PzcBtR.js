The company&#39;s security policy states that each team can access data for only the team&#39;s own customers. Which solution will meet these requirements? A.Create an Amazon Bedrock custom service role for each team that has access to only the team&#39;s customer data. B.Create a custom service role that has Amazon S3 access. Ask teams to specify the customer name on each Amazon Bedrock request. C.Redact personal data in Amazon S3. Update the S3 bucket policy to allow team access to customer data. D.Create one Amazon Bedrock role that has full Amazon S3 access. Create IAM roles for each team that have access to only each team&#39;s customer folders.</p><p>The correct answer is A. Create an Amazon Bedrock custom service role for each team that has access to only the team&#39;s customer data.</p><p>Explanation</p><p>To understand why A is the correct choice, we need to look at how AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon Bedrock interact to ensure data isolation.</p><ol><li><p>The Principle of Least Privilege The company&#39;s security policy requires that teams access only their own customer data. In AWS, the most secure way to enforce this is at the IAM level. By creating a specific service role for each team, you can attach a policy to that role that limits s3:GetObject and s3:ListBucket permissions to specific S3 prefixes (folders) belonging to that team.</p></li><li><p>How Amazon Bedrock Uses Roles When you use Amazon Bedrock features (like Knowledge Bases or Agents), Bedrock &quot;assumes&quot; a service role to perform actions on your behalf—such as reading data from an S3 bucket to use as context for the LLM. If Team A uses Role A, Bedrock can only see Team A&#39;s data. If Team B uses Role B, Bedrock can only see Team B&#39;s data. This ensures hard isolation at the infrastructure level.</p></li></ol><p>Why the other options are incorrect:</p><p>B is incorrect because it relies on &quot;asking teams&quot; to specify a name. This is a manual/application-level control, not a security policy. If the service role has access to all S3 data, a user could accidentally or maliciously request data from another team by simply changing the name parameter. C is incorrect because while redacting personal data is a good practice for privacy, it doesn&#39;t solve the requirement of team-based access control. Updating a bucket policy is part of a solution, but without team-specific service roles, you haven&#39;t defined who (which Bedrock instance) is allowed to see what. D is incorrect because it creates a security hole. If the Amazon Bedrock role itself has &quot;full Amazon S3 access,&quot; then the LLM process has the power to read any team&#39;s data. Even if the human members of the team have restricted access to browse S3, the Bedrock service itself would not be restricted, failing the requirement for strict data isolation during the LLM processing phase.</p><p>Summary of Solution A: S3 Structure: Store data in folders like s3://customer-data/team-a/ and s3://customer-data/team-b/. IAM Roles: Create BedrockRoleTeamA with access only to the team-a/ folder. Deployment: When Team A sets up their Bedrock application/Knowledge Base, they associate it with BedrockRoleTeamA. This creates a secure boundary that satisfies the security policy.</p>",8)])])}const l=t(c,[["render",r]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/066-security-policy.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212680000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"8dc20e2f1b4b500b4a8b691792c2c9b3c12addca","time":1768212680000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Merge pull request #66 from llccing/copilot/fix-vite-build-error"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/066-security-policy.md"}');export{l as comp,m as data};
