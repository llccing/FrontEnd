However, you can add encryption to an unencrypted DB instance by creating a snapshot of your DB instance, and then creating an encrypted copy of that snapshot. You can then restore a DB instance from the encrypted snapshot to get an encrypted copy of your original DB instance.&quot; https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/encrypt-an-existing-amazon-rds-for-postgresql-db-instance.html</p><h2 id="q122" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q122"><span>Q122</span></a></h2><p><strong>Answer:</strong> B</p><p>If you are a developer who needs to digitally sign or verify data using asymmetric keys, you should use the service to create and manage the private keys you’ll need.

Application has to be highly available while the instance and database should not be exposed to the public internet, but the instances still requires access to the internet.
