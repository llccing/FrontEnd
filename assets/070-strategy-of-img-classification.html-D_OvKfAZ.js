To evaluate whether the model is "accurate" at distinguishing between different types of images (e.g., cats vs. dogs), researchers use clustering algorithms (like K-Means). Accuracy through Grouping: If the FM is accurate, images belonging to the same class should be mathematically "near" each other in the latent space. By applying clustering, you can see if the model naturally groups similar objects together. If the clusters align closely with the actual categories, the model has high accuracy in feature representation.

Topic modeling: This is a technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to discover abstract "topics" within a collection of text documents. It is not applicable to image classification. C.

It is a goal of machine learning, not a method for evaluating the accuracy of a classification model. D.
