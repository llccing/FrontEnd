You can back up tables from a few megabytes to hundreds of terabytes of data, with no impact on performance and availability to your production applications. All backups are automatically encrypted, cataloged, and easily discoverable.</p><p>With on-demand backups, you can create a snapshot backup of your table that DynamoDB stores and manages. You&#39;re charged based on the size and duration of your backups. Using on-demand backup, you can restore your entire DynamoDB table to the exact state it was in when the backup was created.</p><p>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Backup-and-Restore.html</p><h3 id="dynamodb-global-table-use-cases" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dynamodb-global-table-use-cases"><span>DynamoDB Global Table use cases</span></a></h3><p>You can evacuate a Region (move away some or all requests going to that Region) should the Region have degraded performance or a full outage, with a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) measured in seconds.
