Sharing data effectively over a network is essential for any organization’s day-to-day operations. NFS enables remote data sharing at the file level. A user (or client device) can use NFS to connect to a network server and access files on the server. Multiple client machines (users) can share the same file without data conflicts. Similarly, iSCSI also allows remote data sharing but at the block level. It enables data exchange between multiple client machines and a block storage device (or block server), which is accessed similarly to a local disk drive.</p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-nfs-and-iscsi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The difference between NFS and iSCSI</a></p>',9)])])}const c=e(s,[["render",n]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/SAA/01Features/StorageGateway.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212680000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"8dc20e2f1b4b500b4a8b691792c2c9b3c12addca","time":1768212680000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Merge pull request #66 from llccing/copilot/fix-vite-build-error"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/SAA/01Features/StorageGateway.md"}');export{c as comp,p as data};
