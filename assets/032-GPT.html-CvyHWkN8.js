The company wants to build an Al-based application that can build a SQL query from input text that employees provide. The employees have minimal experience with technology.Which solution meets these requirements? A.Generative pre-trained transformers （GPT） B.Residual neural network C.Support vector machine D.WaveNet</p><p>Correct answer: A. Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT)</p><p>Why A is correct The company wants an AI application that takes natural language text from employees (who have minimal tech experience) and turns it into a SQL query. That is a natural language → code generation task, specifically text-to-SQL.</p><p>GPT-style models are designed for: Understanding natural language prompts Generating structured text output (like SQL, Python, etc.) Handling varied phrasing from non-technical users</p><p>So GPT (or similar large language models) fits the requirement best.</p><p>Why the other options are not suitable B. Residual neural network (ResNet)<br> Mainly used for image recognition (computer vision), not generating SQL from text.</p><p>C. Support vector machine (SVM)<br> A traditional ML classifier/regressor. Good for classification tasks (spam vs not spam), but not for generating SQL queries from free-form text.</p><p>D. WaveNet<br> Designed for audio generation (speech/waveform modeling), not text-to-SQL.</p><p>Summary Building SQL queries from user text is a generative NLP/code generation problem → GPT is the right tool.</p><h2 id="explain-more" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#explain-more"><span>explain more</span></a></h2><p>A. Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) — Best match What it is:<br> A large language model (LLM) based on the Transformer architecture. It is pre-trained on massive text datasets and then can be fine-tuned or prompted to do specific tasks.</p><p>What it’s good at: Understanding natural language questions/requests Generating text responses Generating code, including SQL Converting “plain English” into structured outputs (tables, JSON, queries)</p><p>Why it fits this question:<br> Employees can type something like:<br> “Show total sales by region for the last 3 months”<br> and the model can generate a SQL query such as: SELECT region, SUM(sales) FROM orders WHERE order_date &gt;= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL &#39;3 months&#39; GROUP BY region; This is exactly a text-to-SQL use case.</p><p>B. Residual neural network (ResNet) — Not suitable What it is:<br> A deep neural network architecture that uses skip connections (“residual connections”) to make it easier to train very deep networks.</p><p>What it’s good at: Computer vision tasks like: Image classification (cat vs dog) Object detection support Image feature extraction</p><p>Why it does NOT fit:<br> ResNet processes images (pixel arrays), not natural language prompts, and it’s not built for generating SQL or text.</p><p>C. Support Vector Machine (SVM) — Not suitable What it is:<br> A classical machine learning algorithm that finds a decision boundary (a “hyperplane”) to separate classes or predict values.</p><p>What it’s good at: Classification (e.g., fraud vs non-fraud, positive vs negative sentiment) Sometimes regression (SVR) Works well with smaller/medium datasets and well-defined feature sets</p><p>Why it does NOT fit:<br> SVM is not a generative model. It does not “write” SQL. At best, you could use it to classify a user request into categories (e.g., “sales query” vs “inventory query”), but it won’t generate a full SQL statement.</p><p>D. WaveNet — Not suitable What it is:<br> A deep learning model originally developed by DeepMind for generating raw audio waveforms.</p><p>What it’s good at: Text-to-speech systems (generating realistic speech) Audio synthesis and modeling sound signals</p><p>Why it does NOT fit:<br> WaveNet is for audio, not for understanding text and generating SQL queries.</p><p>Key idea behind the correct choice The task is: Natural language input → SQL query output<br> That requires an AI model capable of: Natural language understanding Structured text/code generation</p><p>That’s exactly what GPT/Transformer-based generative models are designed for.</p>',24)])])}const p=t(n,[["render",i]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/032-GPT.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212945000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"510851a2e40013ba249eb2696f9e38f188ca533a","time":1768212945000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Update README.md"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/032-GPT.md"}');export{p as comp,d as data};
