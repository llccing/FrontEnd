In this scenario, if the training dataset contained a disproportionately high number of images of a specific ethnic group associated with "theft," or if the dataset lacked enough diverse "normal" behavior from that group, the model "learns" a false correlation.

Measurement bias: This occurs when there is an issue with the way data is collected or measured (e.g., a faulty sensor, a blurry camera, or inconsistent labeling). While this involves the "tools," it doesn't specifically explain the disproportionate flagging of an ethnic group unless the camera itself failed to capture certain skin tones correctly (which is a different technical issue). C. Observer bias (or Experimenter bias): This happens when the person conducting the research or labeling the data projects their own subconscious expectations onto the data. While observer bias can lead to sampling bias (if the human labeling the footage is biased), in the context of ML model performance metrics, "Sampling Bias" is the standard term for the resulting unrepresentative dataset. D. Confirmation bias: This is a human cognitive bias where a person looks for information that confirms their existing beliefs and ignores information that contradicts them. This affects how humans interpret data, rather than how a model systematically processes a dataset.`,-1),e("p",null,"Summary Because the model is incorrectly identifying a specific demographic group, it is a sign that the training data (the sample) was not balanced or representative of the general population, leading to a biased algorithmic outcome.",-1)])])}const c=t(o,[["render",n]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/057-sampling-bias.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212680000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"8dc20e2f1b4b500b4a8b691792c2c9b3c12addca","time":1768212680000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Merge pull request #66 from llccing/copilot/fix-vite-build-error"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/057-sampling-bias.md"}');export{c as comp,h as data};
