It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.</p><p>Just as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) enables storage in the cloud, Amazon EC2 enables “compute” in the cloud. The Amazon EC2 simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use.</p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/?nc=sn&amp;loc=5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EC2 FAQs</a></p><h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-on-demand-instances-and-reserved-instances" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-on-demand-instances-and-reserved-instances"><span>What is the difference between On-Demand Instances and Reserved Instances?</span></a></h3><p>On-Demand and Reserved Instances are two pricing models for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances you can provision in the AWS cloud. Functionally, both types are the same. You can choose from several different compute and memory configurations for different workloads. The difference exists only in pricing. With On-Demand Instances, you pay for computing capacity by the hour or second (with a minimum of 60 seconds) with no long-term commitment. You pay only for what you use, and the instance automatically scales up or down with changing workloads. In contrast, Reserved Instances provide a discounted rate and an optional capacity reservation for your instances. You rent the Reserved Instance for a fixed period at a lower per-second or per-hour rate than the equivalent On-Demand Instance.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability through fleet management for EC2 instances, which detects and replaces unhealthy instances, and by scaling your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down automatically according to conditions you define. You can use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to automatically increase the number of Amazon EC2 instances during demand spikes to maintain performance and decrease capacity during lulls to reduce costs.</p><h3 id="what-is-the-on-demand-instances" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-on-demand-instances"><span>What is the On-Demand Instances?</span></a></h3><p>On-Demand Instances are a pricing model for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances you can provision in the AWS cloud.

Restoring instance availability is also known as instance recovery.</p><p>During the instance recovery process, AWS will attempt to move your instance from the host with the underlying hardware or software issue to a different host. If successful, the instance recovery process will appear to the instance as an unplanned reboot.</p><p>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-recover.html</p><h4 id="relates-questions-is-ec2-default-high-availability" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#relates-questions-is-ec2-default-high-availability"><span>Relates questions: is EC2 default High Availability?</span></a></h4><p>No, EC2 is not default High Availability.</p><p>there are several possibilities to achieve HA with EC2:</p><p>create an autoscaling group with min capacity=1 and max capacity=1. So whenever your instance fails, the autoscaling group will create a new one. The autoscaling group comes for free, so this is not a bad solution depending on your SLA. use ec2 auto-recovery feature by creating a cloudwatch alarm that would replace your instance if failed. create two EC2 instances and use Route 53 DNS failover to resolve to an healthy instance Last but not least: the best solution is definitely to create several instances across several availability zones and to use an elastic load balancer to distribute the traffic. This way, even if an instance fails, you already have other ones available. AWS recommends this solution as they have an SLA of 99.95% for their instance in an AZ. By putting in several AZs you can have 100% availability.</p><hr><p>EDIT: adding information why there is no such native feature for EC2.</p><p>there is no native HA feature in EC2 compared to RDS, because EC2 is pure IaaS when RDS is more PaaS. So for RDS when you select HA, behind the scene it actually spawns a slave database in another availabilty zone and replicates your master. Whenever the master fails, you have an automatic DNS failover to the slave database, which is elected master, and a new slave database is getting created.</p><p>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36709830/ec2-amazon-high-availability-always-on</p>',67)])])}const l=a(o,[["render",i]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/SAA/01Features/EC2.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212945000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"510851a2e40013ba249eb2696f9e38f188ca533a","time":1768212945000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Update README.md"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/SAA/01Features/EC2.md"}');export{l as comp,d as data};
