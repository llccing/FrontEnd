Use a binary classification model to generate code reviews: Binary classification is a statistical method used to categorize data into one of two groups (e.g., "Bug" or "No Bug"). While useful for flagging a specific error, it cannot "generate" a code review, which requires explaining context, logic, and offering improvements. C. Install a code forecasting tool to predict potential code issues: While predicting issues helps with software quality and maintenance, it is more of a preventative measure than a direct productivity booster for the creation of software. It prevents future debt but doesn't necessarily speed up the initial building process as much as code recommendation does. D. Use a natural language processing (NLP) tool to generate code: While the underlying technology behind code recommendation is NLP (specifically Large Language Models), Option B is the specific implementation required for a business. Option B specifies integrating the tool into the developer environment. Option D implies a standalone tool (like a chatbot). A standalone tool is less productive because it requires the developer to copy/paste code back and forth, breaking their workflow.
