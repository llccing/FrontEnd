These instances are powered by custom chips built by AWS specifically for deep learning training (like LLMs). Because they are Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) designed for exactly this task, they do not have the overhead of general-purpose hardware. Energy Efficiency: AWS documentation specifically states that Trn1 instances offer up to 50% energy-cost savings (performance-per-watt) compared to comparable GPU-based instances. By optimizing the hardware architecture strictly for matrix multiplication and deep learning operations, they consume less electricity to perform the same amount of training work. Comparison with other options: A. Amazon EC2 C series: These are CPU-optimized. Training an LLM on CPUs is incredibly inefficient; it would take much longer and consume significantly more total energy than using accelerators. B. Amazon EC2 G series: These use GPUs but are generally optimized for graphics or machine learning inference (running the model), not heavy-duty training. C. Amazon EC2 P series: These are the high-performance GPU instances (typically NVIDIA) used for training. While they are very powerful, AWS Trainium (Trn series) is explicitly marketed as being more energy-efficient and cost-effective for training workloads than these standard GPU instances.',-1)])])}const l=a(r,[["render",s]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/053-ec2-ai-type.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212945000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"510851a2e40013ba249eb2696f9e38f188ca533a","time":1768212945000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Update README.md"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/053-ec2-ai-type.md"}');export{l as comp,m as data};
