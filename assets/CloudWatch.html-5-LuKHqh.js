You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms. Amazon CloudWatch can monitor AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon DynamoDB tables, and Amazon RDS DB instances, in addition to custom metrics generated by your applications and services, and any log files that your applications generate, hosted on premises, hybrid, or on other clouds. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health. You can use these insights to react and keep your application running smoothly.</p><p>To get started with monitoring, you can use Automatic Dashboards with built-in AWS best practices, explore account and resource-based view of metrics and alarms, and easily drill down to understand the root cause of performance issues.</p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS CloudWatch FAQs</a></p><h3 id="combining-alarms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#combining-alarms"><span>Combining alarms</span></a></h3><p>With CloudWatch, you can combine several alarms into one composite alarm to create a summarized, aggregated health indicator over a whole application or group of resources. Composite alarms are alarms that determine their state by monitoring the states of other alarms. You define rules to combine the status of those monitored alarms using Boolean logic.</p><p>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Composite_Alarm.html</p><h3 id="cloudwatch-custom-metrics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cloudwatch-custom-metrics"><span>CloudWatch custom metrics</span></a></h3><p>CloudWatch stores data about a metric as a series of data points. Each data point has an associated time stamp. You can even publish an aggregated set of data points called a statistic set.</p><p>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html</p><h3 id="subscription-filters-log-group-level-subscription" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#subscription-filters-log-group-level-subscription"><span>Subscription filters - Log group-level subscription</span></a></h3><p>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/SubscriptionFilters.html#FirehoseExample</p><p>In this example, you&#39;ll create a CloudWatch Logs subscription that sends any incoming log events that match your defined filters to your Amazon Data Firehose delivery stream. Data sent from CloudWatch Logs to Amazon Data Firehose is already compressed with gzip level 6 compression, so you do not need to use compression within your Firehose delivery stream. You can then use the decompression feature in Firehose to automatically decompress the logs.</p>',18)])])}const l=o(n,[["render",i]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/SAA/01Features/CloudWatch.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212945000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"510851a2e40013ba249eb2696f9e38f188ca533a","time":1768212945000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Update README.md"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/SAA/01Features/CloudWatch.md"}');export{l as comp,m as data};
