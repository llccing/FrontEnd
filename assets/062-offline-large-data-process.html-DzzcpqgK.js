The company must perform inference on large datasets that are multiple GBs in size. The company does not need to access the model predictions immediately. Which Amazon SageMaker inference option will meet these requirements? A.Batch transform B.Real-time inference C.Serverless inference D.Asynchronous inference</p><p>The correct answer is A. Batch transform.</p><p>Here is the detailed explanation of each option and why they are or are not the correct choice for this specific scenario:</p><p>Correct Answer: A. Batch transform Reason: Batch Transform is specifically designed for scenarios where you need to perform predictions on large datasets (high throughput) that are already stored in Amazon S3. It does not require a persistent endpoint. Instead, it starts the resources, processes the data, and then shuts them down. Why it fits the requirements: Large datasets (GBs): It is optimized for processing massive amounts of data in bulk. Archived data: It reads directly from S3. No immediate access needed: It is an offline process. You run the job and check the output later, which is exactly what the scenario describes.</p><p>Incorrect Options:</p><p>B. Real-time inference Reason: This option is used for synchronous, low-latency requirements (e.g., a website needing a prediction in milliseconds). Why it fails: It requires a persistent endpoint (an instance running 24/7), which is expensive and unnecessary for non-urgent, archived data. It also has a maximum payload limit (typically 6MB), making it impossible to process &quot;multiple GBs&quot; in a single request.</p><p>C. Serverless inference Reason: This is for workloads where traffic is intermittent or unpredictable. SageMaker automatically spins up compute power only when a request comes in. Why it fails: Like real-time inference, it is meant for request-response patterns and has a payload limit (up to 30MB). It is not designed for heavy, bulk processing of archived datasets.</p><p>D. Asynchronous inference Reason: This is used for requests with large payload sizes (up to 1GB) and long processing times (up to 1 hour). It queues the requests and processes them as resources become available. Why it fails: While it supports larger payloads than real-time inference, it still requires an active (though potentially scaled to zero) endpoint. Batch Transform is the standard and more cost-effective AWS recommendation for &quot;archived&quot; data and &quot;bulk&quot; processing where you don&#39;t need an endpoint interface at all.</p><p>Summary Table for Decision Making</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">Feature</th><th style="text-align:left;">Batch Transform (Winner)</th><th style="text-align:left;">Asynchronous</th><th style="text-align:left;">Real-time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Data Source</td><td style="text-align:left;">Large S3 files (Bulk)</td><td style="text-align:left;">Single large request</td><td style="text-align:left;">Small single request</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Latency</td><td style="text-align:left;">High (Minutes/Hours)</td><td style="text-align:left;">Medium (Seconds/Minutes)</td><td style="text-align:left;">Low (Milliseconds)</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Endpoint</td><td style="text-align:left;">None (Jobs only)</td><td style="text-align:left;">Persistent/Queue</td><td style="text-align:left;">Persistent (24/7)</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Best Use Case</td><td style="text-align:left;">Archived/Offline data</td><td style="text-align:left;">Large images/Large docs</td><td style="text-align:left;">Mobile/Web apps</td></tr></tbody></table>',10)])])}const d=t(n,[["render",r]]),c=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/062-offline-large-data-process.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212945000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"510851a2e40013ba249eb2696f9e38f188ca533a","time":1768212945000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Update README.md"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/062-offline-large-data-process.md"}');export{d as comp,c as data};
