The customer support inquiries need to be processed and responded to quickly. The company wants to implement Agents for Amazon Bedrock. What are the key benefits of using Amazon Bedrock agents that could help this retailer? A.Generation of custom foundation models （FMs） to predict customer needs B.Automation of repetitive tasks and orchestration of complex workflows C.Automatically calling multiple foundation models （FMs） and consolidating the results D.Selecting the foundation model （FM） based on predefined criteria and metrics</p><p>The correct answer is B. Automation of repetitive tasks and orchestration of complex workflows.</p><p>Detailed Explanation:</p><p>To understand why B is the correct choice, we need to look at what Agents for Amazon Bedrock are designed to do.</p><ol><li><p>What are Amazon Bedrock Agents? Agents for Amazon Bedrock are a fully managed capability that allows developers to create generative AI applications that can perform multi-step tasks. They don&#39;t just &quot;chat&quot; with a user; they &quot;act&quot; on behalf of the user by interacting with company systems and data.</p></li><li><p>Why Option B is the best fit for the Retailer: A retailer handling thousands of inquiries needs to do more than just generate text. They likely need to: Check order statuses in a database. Initiate product returns. Check real-time inventory. Update shipping addresses.</p></li></ol><p>Agents excel here because they provide: Orchestration: The agent uses a foundation model to &quot;think&quot; through a customer&#39;s request, break it down into logical steps, and decide which action to take next. Automation: By using AWS Lambda functions, the agent can automatically call the retailer&#39;s existing APIs to retrieve or update data without a human customer service representative needing to do it manually.</p><p>Why the other options are incorrect:</p><p>A. Generation of custom foundation models (FMs): Amazon Bedrock allows you to fine-tune existing models with your data, but &quot;Agents&quot; are a specific feature for execution and orchestration, not for the base architectural creation of new custom models. C. Automatically calling multiple FMs and consolidating results: While you can choose different models in Bedrock, the purpose of an Agent is to use a specific model to drive a workflow. It is not designed to act as a &quot;meta-model&quot; that runs the same query across several different models (like Claude, Llama, and Titan) simultaneously to compare or consolidate their answers. D. Selecting the FM based on predefined criteria and metrics: This describes &quot;Model Selection&quot; or &quot;Model Evaluation&quot; (Amazon Bedrock has a separate &quot;Model Evaluation&quot; feature for this). An Agent is an application built on top of a model you have already selected.</p><p>Summary For a retailer, Amazon Bedrock Agents act like a &quot;digital employee&quot; that can understand a customer&#39;s problem, look up their information, and solve the issue automatically, which directly addresses the need for quick processing and automation of complex workflows.</p>",9)])])}const c=t(n,[["render",s]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/077-agents-in-bedrock.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212680000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"8dc20e2f1b4b500b4a8b691792c2c9b3c12addca","time":1768212680000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Merge pull request #66 from llccing/copilot/fix-vite-build-error"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/077-agents-in-bedrock.md"}');export{c as comp,d as data};
