Though D is also possible B is more scalable as Lambda will autoscale to meet the dynamic load.</p><hr><p>Ans B - I was going for option D... but then I saw bullrem&#39;s response (1 year, 9 mth ago): &quot;Option D is similar to option B in that it uses Amazon API Gateway to handle the API requests, but it also includes an EC2 instance to perform the tax computations. However, using an EC2 instance in this way is less scalable and less elastic than using AWS Lambda to perform the computations.&quot;</p><h2 id="q172" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q172"><span>Q172</span></a></h2><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C</p><p>CCCCCCCCC Field-level encryption allows you to enable your users to securely upload sensitive information to your web servers. The sensitive information provided by your users is encrypted at the edge, close to the user, and remains encrypted throughout your entire application stack. This encryption ensures that only applications that need the data—and have the credentials to decrypt it—are able to do so.</p><h2 id="q173" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q173"><span>Q173</span></a></h2><p><strong>Answer:</strong> B</p><p>B.

AWS Backup simplifies the backup process and automates the copying of backups to another Region, reducing the manual effort and operational complexity involved in managing separate backup processes for EC2 instances and RDS databases.</p><p>Option B is incorrect because Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM) is not designed for directly copying RDS backups to a separate region.</p><p>Option C is incorrect because creating Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and read replicas adds complexity and operational overhead compared to a dedicated backup solution.</p><p>Option D is incorrect because using Amazon EBS snapshots, RDS snapshots, and S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) involves multiple manual steps and additional configuration, increasing complexity.</p><h2 id="q179" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q179"><span>Q179</span></a></h2><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A</p><p>Agree with A, IAM role is for services (EC2 for example) IAM policy is more for users and groups</p><hr><p>A all day.
