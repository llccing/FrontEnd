This ranking considers factors like helpfulness and harmlessness, especially when prompts are designed to elicit harmful responses. Reward Model Training: A reward model is trained using the human preference data. This model learns to predict a preference score for a given prompt. Model Optimization: The original LLM is then optimized using reinforcement learning, guided by the reward model. The goal is to generate responses that maximize the reward score, aligning the model's behavior with human preferences and safety guidelines.
