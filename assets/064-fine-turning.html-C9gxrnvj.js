Why it works: When a model struggles with "complex scientific terms," it means those terms were likely not well-represented in its original training data. Fine-tuning allows the model to learn the specific vocabulary, context, and relationships between terms in a specialized field. Amazon Bedrock supports fine-tuning for specific models to handle exactly this kind of "domain-specific" knowledge gap.',-1),e("p",null,"Analysis of the Other Options (Why they are incorrect)",-1),e("p",null,`A. Use few-shot prompting to define how the FM can answer the questions. Reasoning: Few-shot prompting involves giving the model a few examples of "Question and Answer" pairs within the prompt to show it how to behave. Why it fails here: While few-shot prompting is great for teaching the model a specific format or style, it is not effective for teaching a model a massive library of complex scientific terminology. If the model doesn’t "understand" the underlying language of the research papers, a few examples won't be enough to fix its lack of specialized knowledge.`,-1),e("p",null,"C. Change the FM inference parameters. Reasoning: Inference parameters include things like Temperature (randomness), Top P (diversity), and Max Tokens (length). Why it fails here: These parameters control the creativity and output style of the model, but they do not add new knowledge. Changing the temperature will not help the model understand a scientific term it doesn't recognize; it will simply make the model guess more or less creatively.",-1),e("p",null,`D. Clean the research paper data to remove complex scientific terms. Reasoning: This involves "dumbing down" the source data so the model can read it more easily. Why it fails here: This is counterproductive for a research company. If you remove the complex scientific terms, you are removing the actual substance and technical accuracy of the research. The chatbot's answers would become vague, oversimplified, or medically/scientifically incorrect.`,-1),e("p",null,"Summary for your Exam When you see a question where Prompt Engineering has already been tried and the problem is highly specialized vocabulary (medical, legal, scientific), the answer is almost always Fine-tuning (specifically Domain Adaptation).",-1)])])}const l=i(o,[["render",r]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/064-fine-turning.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212680000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"8dc20e2f1b4b500b4a8b691792c2c9b3c12addca","time":1768212680000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Merge pull request #66 from llccing/copilot/fix-vite-build-error"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/064-fine-turning.md"}');export{l as comp,h as data};
