With a few selections in the AWS Management Console, you can create file systems that are accessible to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, Amazon container services (Amazon Elastic Container Service [ECS], Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service [EKS], and AWS Fargate ), and AWS Lambda functions through a file system interface (using standard operating system file I/O APIs). They also support full file system access semantics, such as strong consistency and file locking.</p><p>Amazon EFS file systems can automatically scale from gigabytes to petabytes of data without needing to provision storage. Tens, hundreds, or even thousands of compute instances can access an Amazon EFS file system at the same time, and Amazon EFS provides consistent performance to each compute instance. Amazon EFS is designed to be highly durable and highly available. With Amazon EFS, there is no minimum fee or setup costs, and you pay only for what you use.</p><h3 id="when-should-i-use-amazon-efs-vs-amazon-elastic-block-store-amazon-ebs-vs-amazon-s3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#when-should-i-use-amazon-efs-vs-amazon-elastic-block-store-amazon-ebs-vs-amazon-s3"><span>When should I use Amazon EFS vs. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) vs. Amazon S3?</span></a></h3><p>EFS is a file storage service for use with Amazon compute (EC2, containers, serverless) and on-premises servers. EFS provides a file system interface, file system access semantics (such as strong consistency and file locking), and concurrently accessible storage for up to thousands of EC2 instances.</p><p>Amazon EBS is a block-level storage service for use with EC2. EBS can deliver performance for workloads that require the lowest-latency access to data from a single EC2 instance.</p><p>Amazon S3 is an object storage service. S3 makes data available through an internet API that can be accessed anywhere.</p><p>https://zesty.co/blog/ebs-vs-efs-which-is-right/</p><h4 id="next-result-from-ai" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#next-result-from-ai"><span>Next Result from AI</span></a></h4><p>In AWS, Elastic Block Store (EBS) and Elastic File System (EFS) are both storage solutions, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:</p><p>Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)</p><ul><li><strong>Type</strong>: Block storage.</li><li><strong>Use Case</strong>: Ideal for use as the primary storage for file systems, databases, or any application that requires granular updates and access to raw, unformatted, and block-level storage.</li><li><strong>Attachment</strong>: Can be attached to a single Amazon EC2 instance at a time.</li><li><strong>Persistence</strong>: Data persists independently of the life of the instance.</li><li><strong>Performance</strong>: Offers different performance options, such as General Purpose SSD (gp3, gp2), Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1, io2), and magnetic volumes (st1, sc1).</li><li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Must manually resize volumes.</li><li><strong>Backup</strong>: Supports snapshots for backups, which can be used to create new volumes.</li></ul><p>Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)</p><ul><li><strong>Type</strong>: File storage.</li><li><strong>Use Case</strong>: Designed for applications that require shared file access, such as content management, web serving, and home directories.</li><li><strong>Attachment</strong>: Can be mounted concurrently by multiple Amazon EC2 instances across different availability zones.</li><li><strong>Persistence</strong>: Data is stored redundantly across multiple Availability Zones.</li><li><strong>Performance</strong>: Offers two performance modes: General Purpose and Max I/O.

CIFS targets the Windows operating system, while NFS targets Unix. This means they were built to leverage their respective operating system kernels for optimal operations. While it’s possible to use CIFS with Linux-based operating systems (via Samba) and NFS with Windows operating systems (via third-party packages), they aren’t natively supported.</p><h4 id="authentication" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#authentication"><span>Authentication</span></a></h4><p>NFS traditionally relies on host-based authentication, where access to shared files is controlled based on the IP address or hostname of the client machine. It has limited built-in security mechanisms, which can be a concern in open networks.</p><p>CIFS, on the other hand, provides more advanced authentication and security features. It supports user-based authentication, so individual users can access shared resources with their credentials. CIFS also supports encryption and other security mechanisms, which makes it more suitable for secure environments.</p><h4 id="file-locking" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#file-locking"><span>File locking</span></a></h4><p>NFS uses a stateless design, which means it does not keep track of open files on the server. As a result, file locking is handled by the client, and conflicts occur when multiple clients attempt to write to the same file simultaneously.</p><p>CIFS, on the other hand, supports file locking on the server side. It provides better coordination and avoids conflicts when multiple clients access the same file.</p><h4 id="performance-nfs-is-better-for-performance-cifs-is-better-for-performance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#performance-nfs-is-better-for-performance-cifs-is-better-for-performance"><span>Performance, NFS is better for performance, CIFS is better for performance.</span></a></h4><p>NFS uses a lightweight protocol with less overhead, which results in faster file access and transfer speeds.</p><p>Conversely, CIFS has more protocol overhead due to its support for various Windows-specific features.
