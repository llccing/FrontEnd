It provides a managed environment for deploying and scaling applications, including auto-scaling, load balancing, and health monitoring.</p><p>EC2 is a virtual machine service that provides on-demand, resizable compute capacity. It requires more manual configuration and management, including provisioning instances, configuring load balancers, and monitoring health.</p><p>https://www.sitepoint.com/aws-elastic-beanstalk-vs-ec2/</p><h3 id="blue-green-deployment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#blue-green-deployment"><span>Blue/Green Deployment</span></a></h3><p>Because AWS Elastic Beanstalk performs an in-place update when you update your application versions, your application might become unavailable to users for a short period of time. To avoid this, perform a blue/green deployment. To do this, deploy the new version to a separate environment, and then swap the CNAMEs of the two environments to redirect traffic to the new version instantly.</p><p>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.CNAMESwap.html</p>',10)])])}const r=e(s,[["render",o]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/SAA/01Features/ElasticBeantalk.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212945000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"510851a2e40013ba249eb2696f9e38f188ca533a","time":1768212945000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Update README.md"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/SAA/01Features/ElasticBeantalk.md"}');export{r as comp,p as data};
