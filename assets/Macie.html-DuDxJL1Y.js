Macie automatically detects a large and growing list of sensitive data types, including personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, and credit card numbers. It also gives you constant visibility of your data stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Macie’s setup is simplified with one selection in the AWS Management Console or a single API call.
