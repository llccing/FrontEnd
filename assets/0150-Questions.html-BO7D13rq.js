Use S3 Object Lock in governance mode with a legal hold of 1 year. B. Use S3 Object Lock in compliance mode with a retention period of 365 days. C. Use an IAM role to restrict all users from deleting or changing objects in the S3 bucket. Use an S3 bucket policy to only allow the IAM role. D. Configure the S3 bucket to invoke an AWS Lambda function every time an object is added. Configure the function to track the hash of the saved object so that modified objects can be marked accordingly.</p><h2 id="q155" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q155"><span>Q155</span></a></h2><p>A large media company hosts a web application on AWS.
