The company wants to implement an AWS service to handle messages between the two applications. The sender application can send about 1,000 messages each hour. The messages may take up to 2 days to be processed: If the messages fail to process, they must be retained so that they do not impact the processing of any remaining messages.</p><p>Which solution meets these requirements and is the MOST operationally efficient?</p><p>A. Set up an Amazon EC2 instance running a Redis database. Configure both applications to use the instance. Store, process, and delete the messages, respectively. B. Use an Amazon Kinesis data stream to receive the messages from the sender application. Integrate the processing application with the Kinesis Client Library (KCL). C. Integrate the sender and processor applications with an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure a dead-letter queue to collect the messages that failed to process. D. Subscribe the processing application to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to receive notifications to process. Integrate the sender application to write to the SNS topic.</p><h2 id="q165" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q165"><span>Q165</span></a></h2><p>A solutions architect must design a solution that uses Amazon CloudFront with an Amazon S3 origin to store a static website.

Configure an S3 bucket policy to accept requests coming from the AWS WAF Amazon Resource Name (ARN) only. B. Configure Amazon CloudFront to forward all incoming requests to AWS WAF before requesting content from the S3 origin. C. Configure a security group that allows Amazon CloudFront IP addresses to access Amazon S3 only. Associate AWS WAF to CloudFront. D.
