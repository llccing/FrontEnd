Unlike supervised learning, there&#39;s no &quot;teacher&quot; providing the correct answers. Instead, the algorithm explores the input data and tries to discover inherent groupings, relationships, or representations on its own.</p><p>Think of it like this:</p><ul><li><strong>A child exploring a new toy chest:</strong> The child doesn&#39;t have an instruction manual or a parent telling them &quot;this is a car, this is a block.&quot; They just start playing, pushing toys together, noticing similarities (all these are red, all these have wheels), and eventually forming their own categories or understanding of how the toys relate.</li><li><strong>An anthropologist studying a new culture:</strong> They observe behaviors, customs, and interactions without being told &quot;this is a greeting ceremony,&quot; or &quot;this is how they do commerce.&quot; They infer rules, hierarchies, and cultural norms from patterns in the observed data.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Characteristics of Unsupervised Learning:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>No Labeled Data:</strong> The most defining feature. The input data consists only of features, without any corresponding output labels or target variables.</li><li><strong>Discovery of Hidden Structures:</strong> The primary goal is to uncover hidden patterns, intrinsic structures, or underlying distributions within the data.</li><li><strong>Exploratory Nature:</strong> It&#39;s often used for exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data&#39;s composition and relationships.</li><li><strong>No &quot;Correct&quot; Answer:</strong> Since there are no labels, there isn&#39;t a single &quot;correct&quot; output to compare against. Evaluation often involves more subjective measures or domain expertise.</li></ol><p><strong>Common Tasks and Algorithms in Unsupervised Learning:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Clustering:</strong> This is perhaps the most well-known unsupervised task. The goal is to group similar data points together into clusters, where data points within a cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.</p><ul><li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative, Divisive), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).</li><li><strong>Examples:</strong><ul><li><strong>Customer Segmentation:</strong> Grouping customers with similar purchasing behaviors for targeted marketing.</li><li><strong>Document Clustering:</strong> Organizing articles or news stories into topics without prior topic labels.</li><li><strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> Identifying data points that don&#39;t fit into any major cluster, potentially indicating fraud or system errors.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Dimensionality Reduction:</strong> This aims to reduce the number of features (variables) in a dataset while retaining as much relevant information as possible. This is useful for:</p><ul><li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Making high-dimensional data easier to plot and understand.</li><li><strong>Noise Reduction:</strong> Removing redundant or noisy features.</li><li><strong>Improving Model Performance:</strong> Reducing computational cost and potentially preventing the &quot;curse of dimensionality&quot; for subsequent supervised learning tasks.</li><li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Autoencoders (a type of neural network).</li><li><strong>Examples:</strong><ul><li><strong>Image Compression:</strong> Reducing the number of pixels in an image while preserving visual quality.</li><li><strong>Preprocessing for Supervised Learning:</strong> Reducing the feature set before training a classification model.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Association Rule Mining:</strong> This attempts to discover relationships or dependencies between variables in large datasets. It&#39;s often used for market basket analysis.</p><ul><li><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Apriori algorithm.</li><li><strong>Example:</strong><ul><li><strong>&quot;People who buy bread also tend to buy milk.&quot;</strong> A supermarket might use this to optimize product placement.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Anomaly Detection (or Outlier Detection):</strong> While a byproduct of clustering, it can also be a standalone goal. Identifying rare items, events, or observations that deviate significantly from the majority of the data.</p><ul><li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM.</li><li><strong>Examples:</strong><ul><li><strong>Fraud Detection:</strong> Flagging unusual credit card transactions.</li><li><strong>Network Intrusion Detection:</strong> Identifying abnormal network traffic patterns.</li><li><strong>Manufacturing Defect Detection:</strong> Spotting unusual sensor readings in production.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Why Use Unsupervised Learning?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Lack of Labeled Data:</strong> Obtaining labeled data can be extremely expensive, time-consuming, or practically impossible. Unsupervised learning thrives in these scenarios.</li><li><strong>Data Exploration and Discovery:</strong> It&#39;s fantastic for gaining initial insights into a new dataset. You can discover unknown patterns, groupings, and underlying structures that you might not have anticipated.</li><li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> The output of an unsupervised algorithm (e.g., cluster assignments or reduced dimensions) can be used as new features for a subsequent supervised learning task.</li><li><strong>Detecting Anomalies:</strong> Identifying rare and potentially significant events.</li><li><strong>Preprocessing for Other ML Models:</strong> Reducing dimensionality or noise can improve the performance and efficiency of downstream supervised models.</li></ul><p><strong>Challenges in Unsupervised Learning:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Evaluation Difficulty:</strong> Without ground truth labels, objectively evaluating the performance of unsupervised models can be challenging. Results often require human interpretation or domain expertise.</li><li><strong>Algorithm Choice:</strong> Selecting the right algorithm and its parameters heavily depends on the nature of the data and the desired outcome.</li><li><strong>Scaling:</strong> Some algorithms struggle with very large datasets.</li></ul><p>In summary, unsupervised learning is about letting the data speak for itself. It empowers machines to find structure and meaning in raw information, making it an invaluable tool for data exploration, pattern discovery, and handling situations where labeled data is scarce.</p>',13)])])}const g=t(r,[["render",o]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/CPE/02Terms/Unsupervised-learning.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212680000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"8dc20e2f1b4b500b4a8b691792c2c9b3c12addca","time":1768212680000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Merge pull request #66 from llccing/copilot/fix-vite-build-error"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/CPE/02Terms/Unsupervised-learning.md"}');export{g as comp,u as data};
