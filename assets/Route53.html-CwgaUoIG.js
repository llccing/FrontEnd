You can use simple routing to create records in a private hosted zone.</p></li><li><p>Failover routing policy – Use when you want to configure active-passive failover. You can use failover routing to create records in a private hosted zone.</p></li><li><p>Geolocation routing policy – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users. You can use geolocation routing to create records in a private hosted zone.</p></li><li><p>Geoproximity routing policy – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources and, optionally, shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in another location. You can use geoproximity routing to create records in a private hosted zone.</p></li><li><p>Latency routing policy – Use when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to route traffic to the Region that provides the best latency. You can use latency routing to create records in a private hosted zone.</p></li><li><p>IP-based routing policy – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users, and have the IP addresses that the traffic originates from.</p></li><li><p>Multivalue answer routing policy – Use when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random. You can use multivalue answer routing to create records in a private hosted zone.</p></li><li><p>Weighted routing policy – Use to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify. You can use weighted routing to create records in a private hosted zone.</p></li></ul><h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-an-alias-record-and-a-cname-record" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-an-alias-record-and-a-cname-record"><span>What is the difference between an alias record and a CNAME record?</span></a></h3><p>The primary differences between an alias record and a CNAME record are as follows:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Root Domain Support</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Alias Record</strong>: Can be used at the root domain level (e.g., example.com) to point to AWS resources like CloudFront distributions, S3 buckets, or Elastic Load Balancers.</li><li><strong>CNAME Record</strong>: Cannot be used at the root domain level; it can only be used for subdomains (e.g., www.example.com).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Performance</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Alias Record</strong>: Resolved by Route 53 without additional DNS lookups, which can improve performance and reduce latency.</li><li><strong>CNAME Record</strong>: Requires an additional DNS lookup, which can introduce slight delays.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Integration with AWS</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Alias Record</strong>: Specifically designed to work seamlessly with AWS services, automatically updating when AWS resource endpoints change.</li><li><strong>CNAME Record</strong>: Standard DNS record without specific integration benefits for AWS services.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Cost</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Alias Record</strong>: No charge for DNS queries when routing traffic to AWS resources.</li><li><strong>CNAME Record</strong>: Standard DNS query charges apply.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Routing Policies</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Alias Record</strong>: Can be used with Route 53’s advanced routing policies like weighted, latency-based, or geolocation routing.</li><li><strong>CNAME Record</strong>: Limited to basic DNS functionality without advanced routing options.</li></ul></li></ol><p>These differences make alias records particularly useful for AWS environments where integration and performance are key considerations.</p><h3 id="route-53-failover-types" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#route-53-failover-types"><span>Route 53 Failover Types</span></a></h3><p>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-types.html</p><p>You can use Route 53 health checking to configure active-active and active-passive failover configurations.
