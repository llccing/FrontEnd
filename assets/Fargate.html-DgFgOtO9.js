It automatically manages your infrastructure, allowing you to focus on deploying and scaling containerized applications. Fargate is ideal for long-running applications, microservices, or batch processing—where you need fine-grained control over resource allocation (CPU, memory) and want to avoid managing underlying servers.</p><p>AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that automatically runs your code in response to events, and manages the underlying compute resources. It&#39;s best suited for event-driven applications, such as processing files uploaded to Amazon S3, responding to HTTP requests, or running scheduled tasks. Lambda is also well-suited for stream processing and data processing applications due to its ability to scale automatically in response to events and handle high volumes of data in real time. Lambda can process data streams from sources like Amazon Kinesis or Amazon DynamoDB, allowing for efficient, serverless data transformations, filtering, and analytics without managing infrastructure. Lambda is designed for short-lived tasks (up to 15 minutes) and is billed based on the number of requests and execution time, making it cost-eﬀective for sporadic workloads.</p><p>If your project involves event-driven, short-duration tasks or unpredictable workloads, AWS Lambda might be the better fit. If you need to run containerized applications with specific resource needs (or you require persistent processes), AWS Fargate would be more appropriate.</p>',12)])])}const l=a(n,[["render",s]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/SAA/01Features/Fargate.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212680000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"8dc20e2f1b4b500b4a8b691792c2c9b3c12addca","time":1768212680000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Merge pull request #66 from llccing/copilot/fix-vite-build-error"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/SAA/01Features/Fargate.md"}');export{l as comp,d as data};
