For complete list, see the Amazon Data Firehose developer guide. 5) Kinesis Agents, which is a stand-alone Java software application that continuously monitors a set of files and sends new data to your stream. 6) Fluentbit, which an open source Log Processor and Forwarder. 7) AWS Lambda, which is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
