Batch transform\nReason: Batch Transform is specifically designed for scenarios where you need to perform predictions on large datasets (high throughput) that are already stored in Amazon S3. It does not require a persistent endpoint. Instead, it starts the resources, processes the data, and then shuts them down.\nWhy it fits the requirements:\nLarge datasets (GBs): It is optimized for processing massive amounts of data in bulk.\nArchived data: It reads directly from S3.\nNo immediate access needed: It is an offline process. You run the job and check the output later, which is exactly what the scenario describes.")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("Incorrect Options:")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v('B. Real-time inference\nReason: This option is used for synchronous, low-latency requirements (e.g., a website needing a prediction in milliseconds).\nWhy it fails: It requires a persistent endpoint (an instance running 24/7), which is expensive and unnecessary for non-urgent, archived data. It also has a maximum payload limit (typically 6MB), making it impossible to process "multiple GBs" in a single request.')]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("C. Serverless inference\nReason: This is for workloads where traffic is intermittent or unpredictable.

It is not designed for heavy, bulk processing of archived datasets.")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v('D. Asynchronous inference\nReason: This is used for requests with large payload sizes (up to 1GB) and long processing times (up to 1 hour). It queues the requests and processes them as resources become available.\nWhy it fails: While it supports larger payloads than real-time inference, it still requires an active (though potentially scaled to zero) endpoint.
