With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can create an API that acts as a “front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services, such as applications running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) or AWS Elastic Beanstalk, code running on AWS Lambda, or any web application. Amazon API Gateway handles all of the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management. Amazon API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs. For HTTP APIs and REST APIs, you pay only for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out. For WebSocket APIs, you pay only for messages sent and received and for the time a user/device is connected to the WebSocket API.")]),a._v(" "),t("h3",{attrs:{id:"can-i-create-https-endpoints"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#can-i-create-https-endpoints"}},[a._v("#")]),a._v(" Can I create HTTPS endpoints?")]),a._v(" "),t("p",[a._v("Yes, all of the APIs created with Amazon API Gateway expose HTTPS endpoints only.
