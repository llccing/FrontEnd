Observer bias (or Experimenter bias): This happens when the person conducting the research or labeling the data projects their own subconscious expectations onto the data. While observer bias can lead to sampling bias (if the human labeling the footage is biased), in the context of ML model performance metrics, "Sampling Bias" is the standard term for the resulting unrepresentative dataset.\nD.
