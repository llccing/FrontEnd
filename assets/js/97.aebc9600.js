Amazon Textract's machine learning models have been trained on millions of documents so that virtually any document type you upload is automatically recognized and processed for text extraction. When information is extracted from documents, the service returns a confidence score for each element it identifies so that you can make informed decisions about how you want to use the results. For instance, if you are extracting information from tax documents you can set custom rules to flag any extracted information with a confidence score lower than 95%. Also, all extracted data are returned with bounding box coordinates, which is a rectangular frame that fully encompasses each piece of data identified, so that you can quickly identify where a word or number appears on a document. You can access these features with the Amazon Textract API, in the AWS Management Console, or using the AWS command-line interface (CLI).")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);e.default=o.exports}}]);
