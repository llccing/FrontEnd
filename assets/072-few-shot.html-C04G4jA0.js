The company is using a large language model （LLM） from Amazon Bedrock for intent detection. The company wants to use few-shot learning to improve intent detection accuracy. Which additional data does the company need to meet these requirements? A.Pairs of chatbot responses and correct user intents B.Pairs of user messages and correct chatbot responses C.Pairs of user messages and correct user intents D.Pairs of user intents and correct chatbot responses</p><p>The correct answer is C. Pairs of user messages and correct user intents.</p><p>Explanation</p><p>To understand why C is the correct choice, we need to look at the definitions of Intent Detection and Few-Shot Learning.</p><ol><li><p>What is Intent Detection? Intent detection is the process of identifying the purpose or goal behind a user&#39;s input. Input: The user&#39;s message (e.g., &quot;Where is my package?&quot;). Target Output: The specific category or &quot;intent&quot; (e.g., track_order).</p></li><li><p>What is Few-Shot Learning? Few-shot learning is a technique used with Large Language Models (LLMs) like those in Amazon Bedrock where you provide a few examples (usually 2 to 5) in the prompt to show the model how to perform a task. The model follows the pattern of those examples to process the new input.</p></li></ol><p>For the model to learn the pattern of Intent Detection, the examples must follow this structure: Example 1: User Message: &quot;I want to change my password.&quot; Intent: password_reset</p><p>Example 2: User Message: &quot;How much do I owe on my last bill?&quot; Intent: check_balance Current User Message: [New Message here] Intent: [Model predicts this]</p><p>Why the other options are incorrect: A &amp; D: These involve Chatbot Responses. Responses are what the bot says after it knows the intent. They do not help the model map a user&#39;s raw text to a specific intent category. B: Providing pairs of user messages and chatbot responses is used for Response Generation (teaching the bot how to talk), not for Intent Detection (classifying what the user wants).</p><p>Summary To improve Intent Detection accuracy via few-shot learning, the LLM needs to see examples of what the user says (Message) mapped to what that means (Intent). Therefore, Option C is the only one that provides the necessary training pairs.</p>",9)])])}const h=t(n,[["render",r]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/072-few-shot.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768212680000,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowan Liu","username":"","email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"8dc20e2f1b4b500b4a8b691792c2c9b3c12addca","time":1768212680000,"email":"lcf33123@gmail.com","author":"Rowan Liu","message":"Merge pull request #66 from llccing/copilot/fix-vite-build-error"}]},"filePathRelative":"AWS/CPE/03Trick-Questions.md/072-few-shot.md"}');export{h as comp,p as data};
