A solutions architect needs to modify the infrastructure to be highly available without modifying the application.</p><p>Which architecture should the solutions architect choose that provides high availability?</p><p>A. Create an Auto Scaling group that uses three instances across each of two Regions. B. Modify the Auto Scaling group to use three instances across each of two Availability Zones. C. Create an Auto Scaling template that can be used to quickly create more instances in another Region. D. Change the ALB in front of the Amazon EC2 instances in a round-robin configuration to balance traffic to the web tier.</p><h2 id="q175" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q175"><span>Q175</span></a></h2><p>An ecommerce company has an order-processing application that uses Amazon API Gateway and an AWS Lambda function. The application stores data in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database. During a recent sales event, a sudden surge in customer orders occurred. Some customers experienced timeouts, and the application did not process the orders of those customers.</p><p>A solutions architect determined that the CPU utilization and memory utilization were high on the database because of a large number of open connections. The solutions architect needs to prevent the timeout errors while making the least possible changes to the application.</p><p>Which solution will meet these requirements?</p><p>A. Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function. Modify the database to be a global database in multiple AWS Regions. B. Use Amazon RDS Proxy to create a proxy for the database. Modify the Lambda function to use the RDS Proxy endpoint instead of the database endpoint. C. Create a read replica for the database in a different AWS Region. Use query string parameters in API Gateway to route traffic to the read replica. D. Migrate the data from Aurora PostgreSQL to Amazon DynamoDB by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). Modify the Lambda function to use the DynamoDB table.</p><h2 id="q176" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q176"><span>Q176</span></a></h2><p>An application runs on Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets. The application needs to access an Amazon DynamoDB table.</p><p>What is the MOST secure way to access the table while ensuring that the traffic does not leave the AWS network?</p><p>A. Use a VPC endpoint for DynamoDB. B. Use a NAT gateway in a public subnet. C. Use a NAT instance in a private subnet. D. Use the internet gateway attached to the VPC.</p><h2 id="q177" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q177"><span>Q177</span></a></h2><p>An entertainment company is using Amazon DynamoDB to store media metadata. The application is read intensive and experiencing delays. The company does not have staff to handle additional operational overhead and needs to improve the performance efficiency of DynamoDB without reconfiguring the application.</p><p>What should a solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?</p><p>A. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Redis. B. Use Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX). C. Replicate data by using DynamoDB global tables. D. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with Auto Discovery enabled.</p><h2 id="q178" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q178"><span>Q178</span></a></h2><p>A company’s infrastructure consists of Amazon EC2 instances and an Amazon RDS DB instance in a single AWS Region.
