Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC traffic to the NAT gateway in its AZ. B. Create three NAT instances, one for each private subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC traffic to the NAT instance in its AZ. C. Create a second internet gateway on one of the private subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC traffic to the private internet gateway. D. Create an egress-only internet gateway on one of the public subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC traffic to the egress-only Internet gateway.</p><h2 id="q102" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#q102"><span>Q102</span></a></h2><p>A company wants to migrate an on-premises data center to AWS.
